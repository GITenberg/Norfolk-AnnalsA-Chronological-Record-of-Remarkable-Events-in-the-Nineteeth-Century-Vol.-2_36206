v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In the terms of the publishers&rsquo; announcement the two
volumes of &ldquo;Norfolk Annals&rdquo; were to have contained
800 pages; the work has really exceeded that estimate by 255
pages.</p>
<p>Although the period from 1851 to 1900 was marked by many
incidents of great importance in the history of Norfolk and
Norwich, the record thereof in Volume II. of &ldquo;Norfolk
Annals&rdquo; lacks several of the features which made Volume I.
acceptable to the lover of folk lore and to the student of local
events in the earlier days of the Nineteenth Century.&nbsp; If,
however, the present volume be less interesting than Volume I.,
it may yet be useful for the verification of the dates of
occurrences regarding which the public memory is proverbially
shortlived and unreliable.</p>

<h3>1851.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died at Shipdham, Mary, widow of Mr. Henry Tash,
farmer, in the hundredth year of her age.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;At the Norfolk Court of Quarter Sessions a report was
presented upon the expenditure of the county, into which a
committee had inquired in consequence of representations made at
public meetings in various districts, to the effect that the
ratepayers were unable to control the finances.&nbsp; The Court
passed a resolution affirming that the evidence given before the
committee had tended to prove that the financial affairs of the
county had been conducted by the Court of Quarter Sessions with
proper attention to economy, with just regard to the public
interests, and with the publicity required by law.</p>
<p>18.*&mdash;&ldquo;A few days since the steeple of Drayton
church fell to the ground with a tremendous crash, the lead which
covered the falling mass being completely buried in the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;A prolonged magisterial inquiry took place at
Reepham, into disturbances at Lenwade arising out of the Wesleyan
schism.&nbsp; Two parish constables, Samuel Fairman and John
Elliott, were fined for refusing to perform their duty when
requested by the Rev. C. Povah.&nbsp; At Aylsham Petty Sessions,
on February 4th, four persons were charged with disturbing the
Wesleyan congregation at Cawston on January 19th, and three were
committed for trial at the Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; One of the
defendants, Elizabeth Southgate, was ordered by the Court, on
March 13th, to pay a penalty of &pound;40; the other two were
discharged on their own recognisances to appear at the next
Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; A singular case arising from the same
disruption came <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>before the Vice-Chancellor, Lord Cranworth, on May
7th.&nbsp; The relators and plaintiffs were the Rev. William
Worker and the Rev. George Badcock, and the defendants the
trustees of two deeds dated 1814 and 1837, declaring the trusts
of the Methodist chapel at Holt subject to the trusts of a deed
executed in 1784 by John Wesley, by which the Wesleyan body was
organized.&nbsp; The funds for building the chapel were advanced
in 1814 by Mr. Hardy, who, in 1821, received from the trustees a
mortgage of the chapel to secure his advances, which amounted to
about &pound;700.&nbsp; In 1833 the debt was reduced to
&pound;350.&nbsp; The congregation having increased, it was
determined, in 1837, to build a new chapel, and a site was
purchased and conveyed to the trustees upon the trusts of a deed
of another chapel, prepared in 1832, and known to the Methodist
body as the &ldquo;model deed,&rdquo; to which all subsequent
deeds were conformable.&nbsp; By the trusts then declared, such
persons only were to be permitted to preach as should be duly
approved by a Methodist body called the Conference.&nbsp; Mr.
Hardy assisted in advancing money to build the new chapel, and
received as security a mortgage on the chapel.&nbsp; When the
schism occurred it was alleged that the majority of the trustees
of the chapels mortgaged were among the schismatics, who now
called themselves Wesleyan Reformers, and that they had all
formed a scheme of wresting the chapels from the preachers
appointed by the Conference.&nbsp; The defendant united with the
character of mortgagee those of acting trustee and treasurer of
the two chapels, and it was alleged that he was using his powers
as mortgagee, and had publicly recommended others to do the
same&mdash;most of the Wesleyan chapels being mortgaged&mdash;for
the purpose of carrying the general scheme into effect, and thus
to deprive the Conference of the old body of Methodists of the
use of their chapels.&nbsp; Mr. Hardy accordingly advertised the
chapels for sale, and actually sold the old chapel, which was
then in possession of the Reformers for their preachers.&nbsp;
Similar proceedings by ejectment were resorted to by a person
named Hill, to whom Mr. Hardy had transferred his second
mortgage, for the recovery of the new chapel, and led to the
filing of this information, which disputed the propriety of the
transactions.&nbsp; His lordship was of opinion that Mr. Hardy,
as mortgagee, had a right to assert a title adverse to the trust,
and to transfer his mortgage to Hill.&nbsp; It might be proper to
appoint new trustees in the place of those who had ceased to have
any sympathy with the religious body from which they had seceded,
but there was no ground for immediate interference.&nbsp; The
motion was therefore refused, and there was no order as to
costs.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;A great Protestant meeting was held at the Assembly
Rooms, Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel Bignold, at
which were adopted addresses to the Queen and the Archbishop of
Canterbury, protesting against the aggression of the Pope, and
condemning the Tractarian movement in the Church of England.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Douglas&rsquo;s Theatrical Company, which performed
in several of the towns previously visited by the Norfolk and
Suffolk Company of Comedians for so many years under the
management of the Fishers, concluded a successful season at East
Dereham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those who have witnessed the performances
have been agreeably surprised at finding so great an amount of
talent in an itinerant company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>3.&mdash;Died at Lynn, Mr. James Smith, many years
manager of the Theatre Royal, Norwich.&nbsp; He was in his 74th
year.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A performance of &ldquo;Speed the Plough&rdquo; was
given at the Theatre Royal, Norwich, for the benefit of Mr.
George Bennett, the &ldquo;Father of the Norwich Stage,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;a member of the company in the palmy days of the drama
in the city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bennett appeared in the character
of Farmer Ashfield.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Mayor gave his patronage,
and in every part of the dress circle were to be recognised
parties of high respectability, including the old familiar faces
of those who, thirty or forty years ago, were wont to uphold and
maintain the then palmy but now very depressed cause of
legitimate drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; The night&rsquo;s receipts
amounted to upwards of &pound;90.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norwich Town Council resolved to petition the House
of Commons for the total repeal of the Window-tax.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Mr. Peter Master Yarington was presented with a
silver salver and a purse of 283 sovs., in recognition of his
efficient discharge of duty as Superintendent of the Norwich
Police.&nbsp; He was appointed Governor of the City Gaol on July
31st, and was succeeded as head of the police force by Mr. Dunne,
formerly of the Kent constabulary.&nbsp; Mr. Yarington died, in
his 41st year, on July 21st, 1852, and on October 19th of that
year Mr. Robert Campling was appointed Governor of the gaol.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Mr. Albert Smith gave his &ldquo;new literary,
pictorial, and musical entertainment,&rdquo; entitled, &ldquo;The
Overland Mail,&rdquo; at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;A serious riot occurred at Yarmouth.&nbsp; Samuel
Graystone, mate of the Ant, from Yarmouth to Plymouth, had signed
articles to go the voyage, but was forcibly prevented by seamen
from boarding his ship.&nbsp; Masters of other vessels complained
to the magistrates that they had been subjected to similar
treatment.&nbsp; The staff of the East Norfolk Militia and the
Coastguard were called out to keep the riotous seamen in check,
and two troops of the 11th Hussars were conveyed by special
trains from Norwich to assist in quelling the disturbance.&nbsp;
The cavalry rode through the town, and quickly cleared the
streets.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rioters, frightened by the mere
appearance of the troops, flew in every direction up the narrow
rows of the town, and in a few hours tranquillity was
restored.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was stated that, but for the timely
arrival of the troops, a body of Gorleston seamen would have made
an attack upon the town.&nbsp; Several of the rioters were tried
at the Quarter Sessions on March 6th, when, to the surprise of
the Court, a verdict of not guilty was returned.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Died at his family seat, Kirby Hall, the Hon. and
Rev. Lord Berners.&nbsp; &ldquo;He succeeded to the title and
estates on the death of his brother Robert, Lord Berners, better
known in the sporting world as Col. Wilson.&nbsp; He only
attended at the House of Lords on a few occasions, one of which
was to vote for the Reform Bill; but though absent in person, his
proxy was always given to the support of the Whigs, of which,
through life, he was a firm and constant supporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;An exhibition of hawking was given on Hellesdon Brakes,
near Norwich, by Mr. Barr, the celebrated Scottish
falconer.&nbsp; Many hundreds of persons were present.&nbsp; Mr.
Barr used four young hawks of the peregrine species.&nbsp; They
were flown at pigeons which were let loose, and in two hours two
dozen were brought to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>first two or
three were so frightened, that when pursued by the hawk they took
refuge among the people, and one of them alighted on the back of
a horse, and was taken by hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Barr gave a
second exhibition on March 10th, on Mr. George Gowing&rsquo;s
land at Trowse.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;A fire occurred at the office of the &ldquo;Norwich
Mercury,&rdquo; Castle Street, Norwich.&nbsp; The roof of the
building fell in, and the compositors&rsquo; room, with most of
the cases of type, was destroyed.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;Dr. White, the eminent translator of
&ldquo;D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute;&rsquo;s History,&rdquo; delivered,
in the old Council Chamber at the Guildhall, Norwich, a lecture
on &ldquo;The Causes and Consequences of the
Reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Jervis, the libel action, Abbott <i>v.</i> Bacon and Another, was
tried.&nbsp; The defendants published a statement in the
&ldquo;Norwich Mercury,&rdquo; to the effect that the plaintiff,
a superintendent of the County Constabulary at East Dereham, had
stolen certain articles from the shop of Mr. Abram, a chemist and
druggist in that town.&nbsp; The jury assessed the damages at one
farthing.&nbsp; On April 16th a motion was made in the Court of
Exchequer for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection of the
jury, and a rule <i>nisi</i> was granted.&nbsp; At a meeting held
at the Norfolk Hotel, on April 5th, it was resolved, &ldquo;That
the recent trial offered a most painful illustration of the gross
injustice which may be inflicted upon the editor of a newspaper
who honestly and fearlessly comments on matters of general
interest,&rdquo; and a public subscription was opened to recoup
the proprietors of the &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; the loss they had
sustained by their successful vindication of the liberty of the
Press.&nbsp; In the Court of Exchequer, on June 27th, both sides
agreed to a verdict being entered for one farthing damages.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;George Baldry (33) was found guilty, at the Norfolk
Assizes, before Mr. Justice Erle, of murdering Caroline Warnes,
at Thurlton, by striking her on the head with a hammer.&nbsp; The
sentence of death was commuted to transportation for life.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Erle,
John Whitley Cooper and Edmund Slingsby Drury Long, solicitors,
and Frederick Goose, dealer, were indicted for unlawfully
conspiring to obtain, by false pretences, from Sarah Roberts
Tooke, widow, divers goods, furniture, and effects, with intent
to defraud.&nbsp; Cooper was at the time undergoing sentence of
twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment, passed upon him at Norwich
Quarter Sessions on December 31st, 1850, for fraud.&nbsp; He was
now sentenced to two years&rsquo; imprisonment in the Common
Gaol; Long was acquitted, and Goose, who had absconded, forfeited
his recognisances.&nbsp; The victim of this conspiracy, said the
Judge, had been reduced from a position of respectability to one
of absolute ruin.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>12.&mdash;Mr. Fred Phillips, while performing the part of Rob
Roy at Norwich Theatre, fell from a &ldquo;fictitious
precipice&rdquo; and sustained a compound fracture of the bones
of the leg &ldquo;implicating the ankle <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>joint.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was removed to
the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and &ldquo;upon a consultation
among the surgeons it was deemed necessary to amputate the lower
extremity of the bone, an operation which was borne with heroic
fortitude by the poor sufferer.&rdquo;&nbsp; A performance was
given at the Theatre on May 6th for the benefit of Mr. Phillips,
when Mr. George Bennett made his last appearance on the stage, in
the part of Farmer Ashfield, and Mrs. Phillips sustained the
character of Miss Blandford in &ldquo;The Ladies&rsquo;
Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Phillips received a second benefit on
April 20th, 1852, and on July 9th, 1853, announced that he had
taken the Boar&rsquo;s Head Inn, Surrey Street.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The headquarters of the 11th Hussars, commanded by
the Earl of Cardigan, marched from Norwich Barracks for
Nottingham, and were succeeded on the 25th by the 2nd Dragoon
Guard&rsquo;s (Queen&rsquo;s Bays).</p>
<p>&mdash;Samuel Woodhouse, of Plumstead, and William Pyle, of
Holt, were buried alive in a well 115 feet deep, at Docking, by
the falling in of 36 feet of soil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of the
inhabitants proposed to fill up the well and let them remain in
it, stating that the same thing had been done at Tittleshall,
where an inquest was held at the mouth of the well and the body
or bodies remain there to this day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Efforts were
made, however, to recover the bodies.&nbsp; That of Pyle was
found on May 14th, and of Woodhouse on the 15th.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though the bodies had been buried exactly three weeks, on
their being brought to the surface and moved about blood flowed
freely from both of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died, aged 78, Mr. Richard Slann, of Southtown,
Great Yarmouth, historical engraver to her Majesty the Queen.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;The Census returns for the city of Norwich were
published.&nbsp; The number of inhabited houses was 14,990, of
uninhabited 339, and in course of building 101.&nbsp; The
population was 68,706, of whom 31,213 were males, and 37,493
females.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;A pauper named John Rowland, who had had a remarkable
career, died at Lynn Workhouse.&nbsp; He was educated at Eton,
and was afterwards a Fellow of King&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; Ordained deacon and priest by Bishop Horsley, he
officiated at St. James&rsquo;s, Westminster, and went out to St.
Petersburg as chaplain to the Embassy.&nbsp; Subsequently he
either threw off his gown or had it taken from him, and became a
blacksmith and coach-spring maker in Norfolk Street, Lynn.&nbsp;
He was apprehended, tried, and transported for stealing iron, the
property of Mr. Bottomley, of South Gates, in that town.&nbsp; At
the expiration of his term of transportation he returned to Lynn,
made a settlement in the town, and was for several years an
inmate of the Workhouse.&nbsp; He died at the advanced age of 78
years.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died, at the age of 63, at his residence, the Close,
Norwich, Mr. William Ollett, &ldquo;who obtained justly-deserved
eminence as a carver of wood for ecclesiastical purposes, and
whose skill was called into requisition in most of the cathedrals
of this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The &ldquo;members of Reffley&rdquo; celebrated the
62nd anniversary of <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>the building of their temple, &ldquo;the society having
existed before the memory of the oldest inhabitant&rdquo; (of
Lynn).</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The hand of a female was found in Miss
Martineau&rsquo;s plantation, Martineau&rsquo;s Lane, Norwich, by
a lad named Charles Johnson.&nbsp; Other portions of human
remains were discovered between this date and the end of the
month, in various suburbs of the city, namely, at Lakenham,
Hellesdon, Mile Cross, &amp;c.&nbsp; The remains were deposited
at the Guildhall, where they were examined by Mr. Nichols, Mr. D.
Dalrymple, and Mr. Norgate, surgeons, who pronounced them to be
those of an adult female.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January, 1869.)</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>12.&mdash;The Yarmouth magistrates issued a warrant &ldquo;to
apprehend the bodies of George Danby Palmer and James Cherry,
charged on the oath of William Norton Burroughes with being about
to commit a breach of the peace by fighting a duel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The incident arose out of an extraordinary scene at a public
meeting, where &ldquo;Mr. Palmer gave the lie to Mr.
Cherry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Died at Rackheath Hall, in his 83rd year, Sir Edward
Hardinge John Stracey, second baronet.&nbsp; He was born in
India, came to this country as a boy, and was educated at Norwich
Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford.&nbsp; He was
subsequently called to the Bar, was for a time Clerk of the House
of Commons, and succeeded his uncle, Mr. Hardinge Stracey, as
counsel to the Chairmen of Committees of the House of Lords on
Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s appointment to office.&nbsp; For several years
he was Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Cheshire, and a
magistrate for that county as well as for Norfolk and
Suffolk.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Baron
Pollock and a special jury, was tried the action, Baldry
<i>v.</i> Ellis.&nbsp; This was an issue directed to be tried by
the late Master of the Rolls, and involved the disposal of a sum
of about &pound;25,000.&nbsp; The jury had to decide whether one
Bailey Bird, deceased, who contracted marriage in the year 1818,
was competent to make that contract.&nbsp; A large number of
witnesses deposed that Bird was of perfectly sound mind at the
time of his marriage; an equally large number, including several
medical men, asserted that he was an idiot.&nbsp; The jury were
of opinion that Bird was not of sound mind at the time of the
celebration of his marriage, and returned a verdict for the
defendant.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Henry Groom (42) was indicted at the Norfolk
Assizes, before Mr. Justice Cresswell, for the murder of John
Ayton, by shooting him with a pistol, at Burnham Thorpe, on July
4th.&nbsp; He was executed on the Castle Hill, Norwich, on August
16th.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;The steeple of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s, Thetford, fell
upon the roof of the church, carrying away one of the arches and
destroying the organ.</p>
<p>9.*&mdash;&ldquo;A letter from Philadelphia, of the 16th ult.,
announces the death of Mr. Davenport, formerly lessee of the
theatres on the Norwich circuit.&nbsp; He had been making a
successful tour in the United States with his talented
daughter.&nbsp; He died a few days before, at
Cincinnati.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>16.&mdash;On this date was published an extract from the
&ldquo;New York Express,&rdquo; giving particulars of a
confession of murder by a private named Thomson, belonging to the
1st Royals, then stationed at Halifax, North America.&nbsp; He
stated that when at Norwich eight years previously he was on
terms of intimacy with a woman.&nbsp; A quarrel had occurred
between them, and he had thrown her into a canal.&nbsp; The crime
had so preyed upon his mind that he determined to give himself up
to justice and allow the law to take its course.&nbsp; On
September 13th it was announced that Thomson had been brought to
England and committed to Winchester Gaol, pending inquiries by
the police of that city.&nbsp; Two police-officers came to
Norwich, investigated the affair, and elicited the following
remarkable facts: Thomson was stationed in Norwich with the
Carabineers in 1846, and afterwards exchanged to the 1st Royals,
then in Canada.&nbsp; A girl named Anna Barber was in the habit
of frequenting the barracks, and became acquainted with Thomson,
whom she appeared to have displeased.&nbsp; In the month of

superintendent of Sheerness dockyard, and author of two naval
novels, &ldquo;The Petrel&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Albatross.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the second son of Mr. John Fisher,

<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A prize-fight took place on St. Andrew&rsquo;s Green,
near Bungay, between James Perowne, of Norwich, and James High,
of Ellingham.&nbsp; &ldquo;The former was seconded by a man named
Mace,&rdquo; and the other by Smith, of Ditchingham.&nbsp; The
police endeavoured to take possession of the ring, but were put
to flight by the mob; and the men fighting to a finish, High was
declared the victor.&nbsp; Principals and seconds, with the
exception of Mace, were subsequently committed for trial, and at
Beccles Quarter Sessions, on October 18th, were bound over to
keep the peace.&nbsp; Jim Mace was apprehended at Litcham, on
November 2nd, and at Beccles Quarter Sessions on January 3rd,
1853, was ordered to enter into his own recognisances to be of
good behaviour.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at Quebec, Stephen Codman, for thirty-six years
organist of the cathedral church in that city.&nbsp; He was a
native of Norwich, where he received his musical education under
Dr. Beckwith.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The Priory Schools, Yarmouth, were opened by the
Bishop of Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;The site of the schools
originally formed the refectory of the Benedictine friars.&nbsp;
Many of the walls of the priory still remain, and the hall has
been for many years used for the ignoble purposes of a
stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A meeting was held at the Guildhall, Norwich, at
which a public subscription was opened for the erection of a
statue to the memory of the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; On October
4th, 1853, it was decided that the statue should be of bronze,
and Mr. G. Adams was commissioned to prepare the model.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> November 2nd, 1854.)</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at Ormesby, near Yarmouth, in his 82nd year,
Rear-Admiral Black, one of the oldest officers in the Navy.&nbsp;
He had seen much active service, and had been employed on the
North-West coast of America.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;For the office of Mayor of Norwich two candidates
were nominated&mdash;Mr. Samuel Bignold and Mr. Richard
Coaks.&nbsp; The voting was equal, and the Mayor giving his
casting-vote in favour of the latter, Mr. Coaks was declared duly
elected.&nbsp; Mr. George Womack was appointed Sheriff.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> November 23rd.)</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Election petitions were laid upon the table of the
House of Commons, against the return of Messrs. Peto and Warner,
as members for Norwich.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 24th,
1853.)</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>23.&mdash;In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench a rule in
the nature of a <i>quo warranto</i> was applied for, calling upon
Mr. Coaks, Mayor of Norwich, to show by what authority he
exercised that office.&nbsp; The affidavits stated that on
November 9th there were two candidates for the Mayoralty, Mr.
Bignold and Mr. Coaks, and that the retiring Mayor refused to
record the vote of Mr. Cundall in favour of Mr. Bignold.&nbsp;
Consequently the voting was even, and the retiring Mayor gave his
casting-vote in favour of Mr. Coaks.&nbsp; The affidavits further
stated, in support of Mr. Cundall&rsquo;s right to vote, that at
the election of councillors on November 1st, 1851, Mr. Cundall
was a candidate in opposition to Mr. Robert Wiffin Blake, then
one of the aldermen of Norwich, and therefore ineligible to be
elected a councillor; and that Mr. Cundall had, prior to the
election, given notice of Mr. Blake&rsquo;s disqualification, but
that Mr. Blake was elected by a majority of five votes.&nbsp;
Subsequently, on a <i>quo warranto</i> being filed against him,
judgment of ouster was obtained.&nbsp; Mr. Cundall therefore made
the required declaration before two councillors, and took his
seat as a councillor at the late election of Mayor, and claimed
to have his vote recorded for Mr. Bignold, which, if received,
would have placed him in a majority of one over Mr. Coaks; but
such vote was rejected by the retiring Mayor.&nbsp; The Court
granted the rule.&nbsp; The Attorney-General showed cause against
the rule on January 28th, 1853.&nbsp; The Court was of opinion
that Mr. Cundall had made out a clear <i>prima facie</i> case,
and the rule for the <i>quo warranto</i> was made absolute.&nbsp;
Lord Campbell gave judgment in the case on January 21st,
1854.&nbsp; He said it entirely depended on the right of Cundall
to vote.&nbsp; He held that on November 9th, 1852, Cundall was a
member of the Council, and had a right to vote for Mr. Bignold,
and if he had so voted Mr. Bignold would have been duly elected
Mayor.&nbsp; Mr. Coaks had usurped that office, and the <i>quo
warranto</i> had been properly issued.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Crompton
was of the same opinion.&nbsp; Judgment for the Crown.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>11.*&mdash;&ldquo;The long-continued rains have increased the
floods in the valleys of the Eastern division of the
county.&nbsp; Throughout the valley of the Yare, a large extent
of land has been for some time under water, on either side of the
river, for a distance of thirty miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Southery
and Feltwell about 8,000 acres were flooded, and upwards of one
hundred poor families were compelled to leave their
habitations.&nbsp; The estimated loss to the district was between
&pound;25,000 and &pound;30,000, and a public subscription was
opened for the relief of the sufferers.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The Public Library and Museums Act Committee
reported to the Norwich Town Council that it was desirable to
hire the Museum for the use of the public for two days in the
week, and to erect a building for the purposes of a free library,
and that, in compliance with the Act, a rate of one halfpenny in
the pound be levied, one-third to be devoted to the former
object, and two-thirds to the latter.&nbsp; The principle of the
rate was affirmed, and its application postponed for further
consideration.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> September 13th, 1854.)</p>
<p>24.*&mdash;&ldquo;Died at Reedham, a few days since, at the
advanced age of 103, Mr. John Softly.&nbsp; He retained his
faculties and was an active man up to the time of his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>26.&mdash;One of the most terrific storms of wind and
rain ever remembered at Norwich occurred on this date.&nbsp; In
the rural districts many stacks were blown down and scattered in
all directions.</p>
<h3>1853.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;M.&nbsp; Gompertz&rsquo;s panorama of the invasion of
British India by the Sikh Army of the Punjaub was exhibited at
the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.&nbsp; One of the scenic attractions
was a representation of &ldquo;the crypt of the Holy Sepulchre,
under three distinct aspects,&rdquo; a dioramic illusion which
forms a popular feature in similar entertainments at the present
day.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;A miraculous escape was recorded at Swaffham.&nbsp;
A drunken man named Edward Horsepool went into the yard of the
Angel public-house, at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with
the intention of lying down in a shed.&nbsp; By mistake he opened
the door of the covering of a disused well, and stepping in, fell
to the bottom, a depth of 117 feet.&nbsp; A tramp sleeping in the
shed was awakened by the man&rsquo;s cries, and gave an
alarm.&nbsp; Mr. William Laxon, collar maker, procured ropes, and
Horsepool was rescued uninjured, after having been half an hour
in 20 feet of water.&nbsp; He had kept his head above the surface
by clinging to the broken sides of the well.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;In the Prerogative Court, before Sir J. Dodson, was
tried the action Gilbert (administratrix of Woolner) <i>v.</i>
Hammond.&nbsp; It had reference to granting administration, with
will annexed, to the goods of Miss Margaret Creak, of Norwich,
who died on June 5th, 1850, possessed of personal property of
about &pound;30,000 and realty of the estimated value of
&pound;500 per annum.&nbsp; The will bore date January 13th,
1844, and its effect was to leave, with some trifling exceptions,
the personal property to Mr. Woolner, a chemist and druggist, who
was also appointed executor.&nbsp; The will was originally
propounded by Woolner, who afterwards committed suicide, and his
sister, Mrs. Gilbert, now applied for probate, as his
administratrix, which was, in the first instance, opposed by Mrs.
Hammond, a cousin-german and one of the next-of-kin of the
deceased, but she died during the pendency of the suit, and her
husband subsequently took up the case.&nbsp; When the disposition
of the property became known, a great many rumours were put in
circulation, imputing foul play to Mr. Woolner, which was the
cause of his committing suicide.&nbsp; Judgment was pronounced,
on Feb. 4th, in favour of the will.&nbsp; The Judge said the
relatives had a right to inquire into the transaction, and had
they confined themselves within due limits would have been
entitled to costs out of the estate; but they had persisted down
to the close of the argument in charges which they had failed to
prove, and, therefore, in decreeing probate of the will to Mrs.
Gilbert, he must accompany it with the condemnation of Mr.
Hammond in &pound;100 costs, <i>nomine expensarum</i>.</p>
<h4><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>17.&mdash;Mr. C. J. Palmer, at a meeting of the Yarmouth Town
Council, called attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the
Corporation records, and stated that many of the documents in
existence in Manship&rsquo;s time no longer existed, whilst
several others belonging to the town were in the hands of private
individuals in Norwich.&nbsp; A committee was appointed to
examine and schedule the charters and rolls, and to avail
themselves of the services of Mr. Henry Harrod, of Norwich,
&ldquo;for their better elucidation and classification,&rdquo; at
an expense not exceeding &pound;20.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The first snowfall of the season occurred on this
date, and was heavier than had been known for several
years.&nbsp; The mails were delayed, and great inconvenience
occasioned.&nbsp; The morning train from London was detained for
fourteen hours at Lakenheath.&nbsp; At Lynn, on the 23rd, the
tide rose to a great height, and the low-lying parts of the town
were under water.&nbsp; A breach occurred in the river bank near
Magdalene, and occasioned the loss of much live stock and farm
property.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;Died at Leeds, aged 69, the Rev. Robert Fountaine
Elwin, rector of Wilby-with-Hargham.&nbsp; He was well known in
Norwich for the active part he had taken in the Musical Festivals
from their commencement.&nbsp; A few years before his death he
retired to Leeds, where he resided with his only daughter, Mrs.
Hyde.&nbsp; Mr. Elwin not only possessed fine musical taste, but
was skilled in mechanics, and an excellent connoisseur of the
fine arts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether in the company of the great,
presiding at the Choral Society&rsquo;s meetings, or lecturing to
mechanics, it was always delightful and instructive to listen to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Elwin&rsquo;s paternal grandfather married
a granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;In the House of Commons, Capt. Baldero presented a
petition from certain electors at Norwich, who had petitioned the
House against the return of the sitting members, complaining that
their petition had been withdrawn without their consent, and
praying that the order discharging the petition might again be
put on the orders of the House.&nbsp; Mr. T. Duncombe presented a
protest from Col. Dickson, complaining of the withdrawal of the
petition.&nbsp; It was alleged that Mr. Brown, the Parliamentary
agent, had been guilty of a breach of privilege by withdrawing
the petition.&nbsp; A motion for printing the petition was agreed
to.&nbsp; On March 2nd a Select Committee was appointed to
inquire into the matter.&nbsp; The investigation commenced on
March 10th, and concluded on March 17th, on which day Mr.
Duncombe brought up the report of the Committee.&nbsp; They were
of opinion that Mr. Brown had received no instructions to
withdraw the petition, but as they could find no precedent as to
the proper mode of proceeding under the circumstances, they left
it to the House to determine whether it could comply with the
prayer of the petitioner.&nbsp; On March 12th a great Liberal
meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, under the
presidency of the Mayor (Mr. Coaks), at which resolutions were
adopted expressing indignation at the allegations made before the
Select Committee with regard to Messrs. Peto and Warner.&nbsp; A
duel was to have been fought between Col. Dickson and Col.
Forester (a witness before the Committee) on March 19th, but
&ldquo;at the eleventh hour the matter <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>was fortunately adjusted by the
friendly interposition of an hon. member who sits on the opposite
side of the House.&nbsp; Mr. Culpepper represented Col. Dickson,
and Mr. Craven Berkeley, M.P., was the friend of Col.
Forester.&rdquo;&nbsp; It subsequently transpired that the
withdrawal of the petition formed part of an arrangement and
compromise entered into between Mr. Henry Edward Brown and Mr.
James Coppock, solicitor, in pursuance of which eight petitions
were simultaneously withdrawn, as implicating the seats of ten
members of the House, namely, Norwich, 2; Kidderminster, 1;
Gloucester, 1; Middlesex, 1; Youghal, 1; County Down, 2; and West
Norfolk, 2.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;At Norwich Quarter Sessions, before the Recorder,
Mr. Prendergast, the appeal case, Colman <i>v.</i> Clarke, was
heard.&nbsp; Mr. Evans and Mr. Palmer were for the appellants,
and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Bulwer for the respondent.&nbsp; It was
proved that in the early part of May, 1852, Messrs. Colman
established at Carrow a business for the manufacture of cake from
refuse rice, and it was alleged that after the process had been
carried on for a short time offensive smells were observed in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The firm were summoned before the
magistrates for permitting a nuisance, and were fined.&nbsp; They
now appealed against the conviction, on the ground of
informalities in the original proceedings, and of want of
jurisdiction on the part of the magistrates.&nbsp; The conviction
was quashed.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Hengler&rsquo;s Circus and Roman Amphitheatre,
Castle Meadow, Norwich, was opened with the production of a grand
equestrian spectacle, entitled, &ldquo;Kenilworth
Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at his residence, Great Stanhope Street, London,
in his 78th year, General Sir Edward Kerrison, Bart., K.C.B.,
G.C.H.&nbsp; He entered the Army in 1796, as Cornet in the 6th
Dragoons, and received the rank of General in 1851.&nbsp; He
served at the Helder in 1799, and in 1808 took part in the
campaign of Sir John Moore, and was present at the battle of
Corunna.&nbsp; As Colonel Kerrison, he commanded the 7th Hussars
from 1813 to 1815, through various campaigns.&nbsp; At the battle
of Orthes he received a severe wound, and he was again wounded in
the battle of Waterloo, where his horse was shot under him.&nbsp;
Sir Edward Kerrison received his baronetcy in 1821, when he was
nominated a G.C.H., and in 1840 a K.C.B.&nbsp; In 1830 he was
appointed to the colonelcy of the 14th Light Dragoons.&nbsp; For
forty years he was member of Parliament for Eye.&nbsp; He married
a daughter of Mr. Alexander Ellice, and left a son and three
daughters.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at Pulham, Mr. Cornelius Whur, the author of
several volumes of poems.&nbsp; He was known as &ldquo;the
Suffolk Poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The Rev. William Beauchamp was driving down the hill
into Trowse when his horse ran away and upset the gig.&nbsp; In
his fall he sustained a severe fracture of the skull and died
instantly.&nbsp; Mr. Beauchamp, who was the second son of Sir
William Beauchamp Proctor, Bart., of Langley-park, was 35 years
of age, and had been rector of Chedgrave about ten years.&nbsp;
He left a widow and five young children.</p>

21</span>21.&mdash;Three hundred members of the Manchester Unity
of Oddfellows dined at the Royal Hotel, Norwich, and presented to
Mr. Samuel Daynes, Past Grand Master of the Unity, a purse of 133
sovs., in recognition of his exertions in promoting the interests
and extension of the Order during his year of office.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A vessel named the Reindeer, belonging to the port
of Yarmouth, owned by Mrs. King, of Gorleston, and commanded by
Captain Wilson, was on her voyage from Valparaiso to Monte Video
when the crew mutinied, and murdered the captain, steward, and
two Roman Catholic priests (passengers).&nbsp; The mutineers then
launched a boat, filled it with the most valuable portion of the
cargo, and scuttled the ship.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;A fire occurred at Hunstanton Hall.&nbsp; The rooms
were quickly cleared of the paintings and furniture, which were
safely deposited in the school house.&nbsp; There being no
possibility of saving the south and west sides, great efforts
were made to preserve the north and east sides, with which object
the communicating portions of the building were broken down, and
the flames thus prevented from extending.&nbsp; In a few hours
the roof of the west side fell in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bed in which
it is generally believed Queen Elizabeth slept was not injured in
the slightest degree.&rdquo;&nbsp; The damage to the hall was
estimated at &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Norwich of the birth of
a Prince (Prince Leopold), at Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; Flags were
hoisted on the public buildings, and peals rung upon the bells of
St. Peter Mancroft.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The men enrolled to serve in the First or West
Norfolk Regiment of Militia assembled at Norwich for twenty-eight
days&rsquo; training.&nbsp; The officers were: Col. the Earl of

Smith, Robert G. Hawtayne; Ensign Thomas Edward Baker; Adjutant
and Acting Paymaster and Acting Quartermaster A. W. Smith;
Surgeon Thomas W. Crosse; Assistant Surgeon T. E. Baker.&nbsp;
The mess was at the Swan Hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The corps consists
of 612 men, and notwithstanding the vulgar sneers, reproaches,
ridicule, and even hooting which they experienced from the rabble
on their first appearance in the streets, in no instance was this
conduct resented.&nbsp; We are glad that the conduct of our
Liberals, by publicly parading disgusting flags, and the Peace
Society in circulating exciting and seditious handbills, with the
view to holding up this force to contempt and ridicule, has
signally failed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The East Norfolk Militia assembled
at Yarmouth on the same date.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their appearance was
much more respectable than might have been expected, and many of
those who were prepared to ridicule them acknowledged that they
were a much better class than they expected.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
officers were: Col. the Hon. Berkeley Wodehouse; Lieut.-Col.
William Mason; Major Sir E. K. Lacon; Captains John Longe, the
Hon. Bertram Wodehouse, John Marcon, Henry Cormick, George

Thomas Smyth.&nbsp; Of the 612 men enrolled, 571 appeared on
parade.&nbsp; The Earl of Leicester, as Lord Lieutenant of the
county, inspected the East Norfolk Regiment at Yarmouth on May
12th, and the West Norfolk Regiment at Norwich on the 13th.&nbsp;
The men of the latter corps were entertained at dinner at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall after the inspection.&nbsp; The cost of the
entertainment was defrayed by public subscription.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The foundation-stone of the Wayland Hall, Watton,

Wayland Society, at which Lord Walsingham presided.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A fine schooner, named the Ocean Child, was launched
from the ship-yard of Mr. Southgate, at Wells-next-the-Sea.</p>
<p>30.*&mdash;&ldquo;Died lately at Bergh Apton, at an advanced
age, Mr. John Dawson, deputy registrar for the Loddon
Union.&nbsp; He was likewise known as an active peace
officer.&nbsp; Previous to the establishment of the police force,
the whole business of thief-taking devolved upon petty
constables, but as the requisite tact and intelligence was not
found in every parish, what was called a running constable was
usually appointed in each petty sessional division, who was
considered the detective-officer of the district.&nbsp; Mr.
Dawson was justly considered one of the first of his
profession.&nbsp; Upon the formation of the new force these
hitherto indispensable functionaries were entirely superseded,
and Dawson, among others, found his occupation gone.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>20.&mdash;There were no prisoners in Lynn gaol.&nbsp; To
celebrate the unique circumstance the prison doors were thrown

eleven of All England, commenced on the new Cricket Ground,
Newmarket Road, Norwich, and concluded on the 11th.&nbsp;
Norwich, 110&mdash;46; All England, 58&mdash;70.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The City of Norwich Waterworks New Bill received the
Royal assent.&nbsp; &ldquo;By this Bill power is given to the
Corporation of Norwich to convert Chapel Field into a public
pleasure garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Announcement was made of the resignation of
Superintendent Dunne, of the Norwich police &ldquo;on the ground
that he had been so much obstructed by those who ought to have
assisted him in the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>discharge of his duties, that no alternative had been
left him but to resign.&rdquo;&nbsp; On July 6th Mr. Stephen
English, of Pontefract, was elected to the post.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Died, at Doughty&rsquo;s Hospital, Norwich, in her
81st year, Miss Tubby, &ldquo;well-known as box-keeper at our
Theatre for many years, and highly respected.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
possessed a remarkable fund of information upon local theatrical
matters, and for nearly half a century &ldquo;Miss Tubby&rsquo;s
night&rdquo; was one of the principal events in the Norwich
season.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The new cult of &ldquo;table-turning&rdquo; or
spiritualism was introduced in Norwich for the first time at a
<i>s&eacute;ance</i> given at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall by a Mr.
King.</p>
<p>&mdash;The first piles of the Wellington Pier at Yarmouth were
driven by the Mayor (Mr. S. C. Marsh), Mr. D. Waddington,
chairman of the United Norfolk and Eastern Counties&rsquo;
Railway Companies and of the Pier directors, and by the
Mayoress.&nbsp; A dinner was held at the Victoria Hotel in
celebration of the event.&nbsp; The Pier was opened by the Mayor
on October 31st.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;At the Norfolk Quarter Sessions it was reported that
the Secretary of State for the Home Department had ordered the
formation of a corps of Artillery Militia for the county.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;A thunderstorm of great severity occurred at
Norwich.&nbsp; The main sewer in London Street burst from the
enormous pressure upon it, and its contents inundated the
adjacent business premises.&nbsp; Every house at the bottom of
Exchange Street was flooded, and fire-engines were afterwards
employed to pump the water from the cellars.&nbsp; The weather
continued to be very stormy during the succeeding week.&nbsp; The
newly-completed tower and spire of Mundham church were wrecked
and became a heap of ruins.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Three troops of the 6th Dragoon Guards
(Carabineers), under the command of Capt. Sawyer, marched into
Norwich from Chobham Camp.&nbsp; The headquarters were stationed
at Ipswich.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Miss Fanny Vining appeared at Norwich Theatre as
Margaret Elmore in &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>
announced the repeal of the advertisement duty and of the duty
upon newspaper supplements.</p>
<p>31.*&mdash;Died at Shoreditch Workhouse, London, Benjamin
Reeder, of Helhoughton, who was in many respects a very
remarkable character.&nbsp; He had served sixteen years as a
private in the 2nd Dragoon Guards.&nbsp; &ldquo;Altho&rsquo; of
an obtuse and somewhat forbidding appearance, he possessed an
uncommon faculty for mathematical attainments.&nbsp; He had
Euclid at his finger ends, while his knowledge of algebra and
logarithms enabled him to solve in a few minutes the most
difficult questions.&nbsp; He once had the management of a
school, but his irregularities reduced him to the level of a
common labourer, and eventually he ended his days in the union
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.*&mdash;&ldquo;The degree of Doctor of Music has been
recently conferred on Mr. Buck, organist of Norwich Cathedral, by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the exercise of the privilege
possessed by his Grace as Primate of bestowing that and other
degrees in divinity and arts upon persons of merit in any of
those faculties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;An interesting ceremony took place in the tower of
the dilapidated church of Eccles-next-the-Sea.&nbsp; The Rev.
Edward Evans, of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Norwich, who had recently
been presented to the vicarage, read himself in, and preached to
a congregation of about 200 persons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Owing to the
want of the church, which has been destroyed upwards of 200 years
by the encroachments of the ocean, this is a sinecure benefice,
and the inhabitants use the neighbouring church of
Hempstead.&nbsp; The tower of the church in which the ceremony
took place is embedded in sand to the height of the former walls
of the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;George Borrow performed an intrepid act on Yarmouth
beach.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sea raged frantically, and a ship&rsquo;s
boat, endeavouring to land for water, was upset, and the men were
engulfed in a wave some 30 feet high, and struggling with it in
vain.&nbsp; The moment was an awful one, when George Borrow, the
well-known author of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Bible
in Spain,&rsquo; dashed into the surf and saved one life, and
through his instrumentality the others were saved.&nbsp; We
ourselves have known this brave and gifted man for years, and
daring as was his deed, we have known him more than once risk his
life for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17*.&mdash;&ldquo;If the rivalry of the different railway
companies in this district has been agreeable to the public it
has been attended with fearful loss to the shareholders.&nbsp;
Excursionists are not expected to object to being carried from
Norwich to London for half a crown, but we should suppose that
the proprietors in the Eastern Union will have a decided
objection to the great increase of their working expenses to 60
per cent. by the process.&nbsp; The ruinous competition now going
on can only be terminated by a union of interests, and it
appears, from the reports of the Eastern Counties&rsquo; and
Eastern Union Companies, that an amalgamation is
proposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The kitchen floor of a house, occupied by Mr. Bunting,
on St. Giles&rsquo; Hill (near St. Giles&rsquo; Gates?), Norwich,
suddenly gave way, and Mrs. and Miss Bunting, who were in the
apartment, were precipitated with the chairs, table, and other
furniture, into a funnel-shaped hole 27 feet in depth.&nbsp; When
rescued they were insensible but uninjured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caves
were some time since cut through the hill in different directions
and of considerable length, and the whole of the hill has been at
various periods excavated for chalk.&nbsp; Some of the caves were
used for wine vaults, and it appears that one of these caves
passed under the back of Mr. Bunting&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; A
water-pipe had been leaking for a long time, and it is supposed
that the water descending through the soil caused the roof of the
cave to give way, and the whole of the earth above to fall with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A young man named E. Elson completed the task of
walking from Lynn to Dereham and back, a distance of 60 miles,
for six successive days.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;A violent hurricane of wind and rain did great
damage in the county.&nbsp; &ldquo;The injury to orchards and
gardens has been immense, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and the apple crop, which was an
abundant one, has been reduced probably one-half.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the coast there were many shipping casualties, attended by loss
of life.</p>

of Lieut. S. Gurney Cresswell, the bearer of the despatches from
Commander M&rsquo;Clure, relating to the expedition in search of
Sir John Franklin.&nbsp; Lieut. Cresswell was presented with a
congratulatory address at a meeting held at the Guildhall, and
afterwards entertained at dinner at the Assembly Rooms.&nbsp; He
was third son of Mr. Francis Cresswell, a partner in the banking
firm of Gurney, Cresswell, and Co., King&rsquo;s Lynn, and a
native of the borough, where he was born in 1827.&nbsp; Not only
was he the bearer of the despatches announcing the discovery of
the North-West passage, but he had taken an active and important
part in the expedition.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;Died at his residence, Monmouth Road, Bayswater, Dr.
Bexfield.&nbsp; He was born in Norwich on April 27th, 1824, and
at seven years of age became a chorister at the Cathedral.&nbsp;
At the age of eleven he composed an anthem in eight parts, which
fully satisfied Mr. Buck that he possessed extraordinary
talent.&nbsp; On the expiration of his articles in his 21st year,
he was elected organist of Boston parish church, and in the same
year graduated Mus. Bac. at Cambridge.&nbsp; He afterwards
published his Concert Fugues for the organ, which were played
during the Great Exhibition.&nbsp; In 1847 he composed his
&ldquo;Six Songs,&rdquo; and earned for himself the popular
distinction of &ldquo;the Poet-Musician.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
appointed, out of thirty-five candidates, organist at St.
Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate, London.&nbsp; At about this time he
published a collection of pieces under the title of &ldquo;Musica
di Camera,&rdquo; and at the age of twenty-four took the degree
of Mus. Doc.&nbsp; Dr. Bexfield was the author of a volume of
&ldquo;Church Anthems,&rdquo; which formed part of the repertoire
of most English cathedrals.&nbsp; In 1850 he married a daughter
of Mr. J. B. Millington, solicitor of Boston.&nbsp; The work on
which his reputation mainly depended was his oratorio
&ldquo;Israel Restored,&rdquo; which on two occasions he
conducted at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, viz., at its first
production at the Choral Society&rsquo;s concert in October,
1851, and at the Musical Festival in 1852.&nbsp; A benefit
concert was given at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall on December 16th for
his widow and family.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;500, including a
donation of 20 guineas from the Queen, was realised.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at St. Leonard&rsquo;s-on-Sea, the Right Hon.
Lord Charles Vere Ferrars Townshend, of Rainham Hall and Tamworth
Castle.&nbsp; <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>He was born in 1783, and in 1812 married his cousin, the
eldest daughter of General William Loftus.&nbsp; The funeral took
place at Rainham on November 24th.&nbsp; He was succeeded in his
estates by his nephew, Capt. John Townshend, R.N., member for

Birkbeck appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A new church was opened at Wootton.&nbsp; It was
built on the site of the old church at the sole expense of the
Hon. Mrs. Howard.&nbsp; It cost nearly &pound;6000.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The announcement was published that Mr. David
Fisher, the actor, who was so well known and highly respected in
Norwich and Norfolk, had made a successful <i>d&eacute;but</i> at
the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre, London.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;In the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court application was
made in the suit Jermy <i>v.</i> Jermy for the administration of
the estate of the late Mr. Jermy, of Stanfield Hall.&nbsp; The
only question that arose was about certain timber growing on the
estate and fines of copyholds.&nbsp; But a difficulty of a novel
character had occurred.&nbsp; Since the murder the mansion had
been untenanted.&nbsp; Although many persons were willing to take
it they could not procure servants who would live in the house,
so great was the superstitious feeling which existed.&nbsp; It
was stated that the parties were willing to allow the house to be
occupied for two years for nothing, in order to overcome the
prejudice.&nbsp; The Vice-Chancellor said that Mrs. Jermy Jermy
was entitled to a third of the timber and fines, and he expressed
surprise that such prejudices existed against the house.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;Died, at her residence on the Castle Meadow, Norwich,
in her 85th year, Amelia Opie, widow of John Opie, R.A., and only
daughter of Dr. James Alderson.&nbsp; After her marriage with
Opie in 1798 her numerous literary productions gained her
considerable reputation, and as a novelist she moved in the
highest literary circles.&nbsp; Her works included &ldquo;Father
and Daughter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Simple Tales,&rdquo; 4 vols. (1806);
&ldquo;New Tales,&rdquo; 4 vols. (1818); &ldquo;Temper, or
Domestic Scenes,&rdquo; 3 vols.; &ldquo;Tales of the
Heart,&rdquo; 4 vols.; &ldquo;Detraction Displayed&rdquo; (moral

the Dead,&rdquo; and other poems.&nbsp; Mrs. Opie was a member of
the Society of Friends, and her remains were interred in the
Quakers&rsquo; Burial Ground, Gildencroft, on December 9th.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The provision of a time-ball connected by electric
telegraph with Greenwich Observatory, and exhibited in a
prominent position in Norwich Market Place, was, in consequence
of the irregularities of the public clocks, advocated in the
<span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> on this date.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;A meeting of the landowners, farmers, and tradesmen
of Harleston and the district was held at the Corn Hall in that
town, to consider the desirability of promoting the construction
of a railway <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>from Tivetshall station on the Eastern Union line.&nbsp;
In 1851 an Act of Incorporation was obtained for making a railway
from Tivetshall to Bungay, but from various causes, chiefly from
the depression in the railway world, no further steps were at
that time taken.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died, at the house of his son-in-law at Cambridge,
aged 69, Mr. Seth William Stevenson, F.S.A., one of the
proprietors of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span>.&nbsp; He was elected Sheriff of Norwich in
1828, he became alderman in the same year, and in 1832 served the
office of Mayor.&nbsp; Literary pursuits, especially of an
antiquarian character, engrossed his leisure.&nbsp; In early life
Mr. Stevenson made several Continental tours.&nbsp; The year
after the battle of Waterloo, he, in company with Capt. Money,
visited the scene of the struggle, and afterwards published
&ldquo;A Journal of a Tour through part of France, Flanders and
Holland, including a Visit to Paris and a Walk over the Field of
Waterloo in the Summer of 1816.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work was
dedicated to the Norwich United Friars Society, of which literary
body he was almost the last surviving member.&nbsp; In 1828
appeared the account of a second tour in Italy, Switzerland,
Germany, and the Netherlands.&nbsp; The book to which he devoted
no inconsiderable portion of the last ten years of his life was
the complete &ldquo;Dictionary of Roman Coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24*.&mdash;&ldquo;We have received from Mr. Garthon, one of
the district surgeons of Norwich, a return in a tabular form
showing the extraordinary number of 96 cases of small-pox in
Heigham and St. Benedict&rsquo;s, during the last three
months.&nbsp; These arose from the strong prejudice still
existing amongst ignorant and poor people against the only
preventive&mdash;vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The funeral of the Marchioness of Wellesley took place
at Costessey Hall, whither the remains had been removed from
Hampton Court.&nbsp; &ldquo;In accordance with the good old
charitable practice a dole of bread was given to the poor of
Costessey on the occasion of the funeral.&rdquo;</p>

his 71st year, Mr. Richard Hanbury Gurney.&nbsp; He was the son
of Mr. Richard Gurney, of Keswick, and in early life was a member
of the Society of Friends.&nbsp; In 1818 Mr. Gurney was elected
member for Norwich in conjunction with Mr. W. Smith; he was
re-elected in 1820, in 1830, and in 1831.&nbsp; At the General
Election in 1832 he and the other Liberal candidate, Mr. Ker,
were, after a very severe contest, defeated <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>by Lord
Viscount Stormont and Sir James Scarlett.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney was a
patron of the Turf and a genuine lover of old English sports, but
he was never known to bet.&nbsp; His remains were interred, on
January 9th, at the Rosary Burial-ground, Norwich.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;A heavy snowstorm, accompanied by a severe gale from
the north, passed over the Eastern district.&nbsp; The snow was
deeper than had been known for many years previously; all the
roads were blocked, and railway communication between Yarmouth
and London was stopped.&nbsp; The telegraph poles were blown
down, and the wires broken.&nbsp; A train which left Fakenham at
6 a.m. did not reach Norwich till 5.15 p.m.&nbsp; At the Norfolk
Quarter Sessions, at Norwich, on the 4th, it was found impossible
to form a grand jury, in consequence of the non-attendance of
those who had been summoned.&nbsp; All travelling by road was
suspended for some days; the port of Lynn was frozen up, and
several ships were driven ashore at Yarmouth.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A serious collision occurred on the line near
Thetford.&nbsp; A train conveying sixty navvies, who were
employed to clear away the snowdrifts, ran into the down train
from London.&nbsp; &ldquo;The engines rose up into the air, and
two men on them were instantly killed; two others in the train
from Norwich were also killed by the tender being driven through
the carriage in which they were seated.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev.
Joseph Bell, of Barningham, a passenger in the London train, died
on the 8th from the injuries he received, and Mr. Thomas Ellison,
of Dove Street, Norwich, another passenger, succumbed on the
14th.&nbsp; The Coroner&rsquo;s jury, after repeated
adjournments, returned, on February 6th, a verdict of
manslaughter against Mr. Peter Ashcroft, superintendent of the
permanent way, and Mr. John Latham, locomotive superintendent,
who, it was alleged, had acted contrary to the orders of Mr.
King, station-master at Harling Road.&nbsp; At the Norfolk
Assizes, on March 24th, before Lord Chief Baron Pollock, the
jury, without hearing the defence, acquitted the defendants.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died at Heigham Hall (private lunatic asylum),

<p>21.*&mdash;&ldquo;An invention calculated to prove of great
national benefit has been recently patented by Mr. Samuel
Rainbird, carpenter, of Norwich.&nbsp; It is described in the
specifications as an apparatus for grappling and raising sunken
vessels and other submerged bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A meeting of the Deputy Lieutenants of the county
decided, by 25 votes to three, that Yarmouth was the most
suitable place in the district at which to centre the three
regiments of Norfolk Militia.&nbsp; At another meeting, held on
February 25th, the former resolution was rescinded, and it was
agreed &ldquo;that the present Committee be empowered to receive
estimates and tenders for building barracks for one regiment of
Militia at Norwich, and for one regiment of Militia and one
regiment of artillery at Yarmouth, on such plans as they may
think best suited for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died near Holston River, in Knox County, East
Tennessee, North America, Mr. William Forster, of Earlham Road,
Norwich, in his 70th year.&nbsp; He was a member of the Society
of Friends, and a brother-in-law of Mr. Fowell Buxton.&nbsp; He
went out in the autumn of 1853 to <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>carry petitions to the slave States
of the Union, on behalf of the oppressed Africans.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;At a meeting convened by the Mayor (Mr. Bignold), and
held at the Guildhall, Norwich, petitions to both Houses of
Parliament were adopted in favour of an Act &ldquo;for the legal
prohibition of the sale of intoxicating drink during the whole of
Sunday (except to <i>bona fide</i> travellers).&rdquo;&nbsp; A
committee was appointed to make arrangements for forming a Sunday
Closing Association.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;A troop of the Carabineers marched from Norwich
Barracks, to join the headquarters at Ipswich.&nbsp; The
remaining troop left on May 1st.</p>
<p>&mdash;In the Rolls Court, before the Master of the Rolls, was
heard the case, the Attorney-General <i>v.</i> Hudson, in
<i>re</i> the Grammar School and Hospital at Norwich.&nbsp; This
was an information filed by the Attorney-General, at the relation
of certain inhabitants of the city, against the trustees
appointed under the Corporation Act, of two charities called the
Free Grammar School and the Great Hospital.&nbsp; The object of
the information was to show that the Grammar School had not
received a fair amount of the funds of the charity, and that
undue preference had been given to the Hospital in their
distribution.&nbsp; A decree was made, directing a scheme to be
settled in Chambers.&nbsp; On December 18th it was stated in the
Rolls Court that when the case was in Chambers a deed of
covenant, contemporaneous with the letters patent of King Edward
VI., and to which the Corporation were parties, had been found,
by which the whole surplus, after the stipulated payments, was to
be applied to the sustentation of the poor.&nbsp; The question
then before the Court was how far this varied the case.&nbsp; It
was contended that the Hospital and the poor were entitled to the
entire surplus.&nbsp; The Master of the Rolls was of opinion that
the deed did not control the letters patent, that no predominance
or priority was given to one part of the charity over the other,
and that the surplus rents should be equally divided, and in such
a way as would be most consistent with the intentions of the
founder.&nbsp; The case was taken before the Chief Clerk to the
Master of the Rolls on February 6th, 1855.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
result is that upwards of &pound;1,000 per annum in addition to
the property comprised in the charter will be secured for the
general benefit of the charity, including, of course, the
School.&nbsp; The matter now stands over, in order that a scheme
may be prepared for the general administration of the charity
under the sanction of the Attorney-General.&rdquo;&nbsp; On April
7th, 1855, it was announced that the following proposal had been
made on the part of the &ldquo;promoters of the new Grammar
School&rdquo; as to the future division of the funds
&ldquo;hitherto belonging to the Great Hospital&rdquo;:
&ldquo;That the present salary of the chaplain of the said
Hospital be increased &pound;100 per annum, he having at present
&pound;200 per annum besides his residence; that one moiety of
the net income of the charity be annually applied for the benefit
of the School and the objects thereof, and that the other moiety
be applied for the benefit of the poor in the Hospital; and that
no further election of inmates shall be allowed to take place
until the number shall by death or other causes be reduced to
100, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and
that until the numbers shall be so reduced, the expenses
occasioned thereby shall be provided for out of the savings of
the trust and now invested in the sum of &pound;11,500 Consols,
or out of any other monies in the hands of the
defendants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another meeting was held in Chambers on
May 9th, 1855, when the trustees strongly opposed the heads of
the scheme; thereupon it was proposed that the Chief Clerk should
proceed to Norwich and hold an inquiry.&nbsp; The trustees
claimed the right to appeal against his decision, if necessary,
and the Chief Clerk then declined to accede to the
proposal.&nbsp; The trustees were invited to carry in the counter
claim, but refused to do so.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> June 16th,
1857.)</p>
<p>13.&mdash;Henry Russell gave his entertainments, &ldquo;The
Far West,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Negro Life,&rdquo; in the presence of
between 2,000 and 3,000 persons, at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
Norwich.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;A meeting of the citizens was held at the Guildhall,
Norwich, presided over by the Mayor (Mr. S. Bignold), at which it
was agreed &ldquo;that the wives and children of the Army of
England called at this time on the service of their country to
the seat of war, claim the sympathy of the British public, and
that a subscription be forthwith commenced to relieve all such
women and children as may be left in destitution and
want.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similar funds were raised in other parts of
the county.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Baron
Parke, William Thompson, aged 21, was charged with the murder of
Lorenzi Beha, at Tittleshall, on November 18th, 1853.&nbsp; Mr.
Evans prosecuted, and Mr. Carlos Cooper defended.&nbsp; The
prisoner was found guilty, and sentenced to death.&nbsp; The
execution took place on the Castle Hill, Norwich, on April
8th.&nbsp; &ldquo;The criminal&rsquo;s struggles continued five
minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lowest and most degraded classes in the
city and county assembled on the Hill, &ldquo;and more scenes of
drunkenness and immorality were exhibited than had been seen for
a long time previously in Norwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.*&mdash;&ldquo;At the Walsingham Quarter Sessions, the
Grand Jury, in making their presentment, called the attention of
the Court to the prevailing nuisance occasioned by carts drawn by
dogs, and to the facilities thus afforded for the commission of
felonies.&nbsp; They recommended that some decisive steps be
taken to procure an extension of the Act providing against this
evil in and around London.&rdquo;&nbsp; The provisions of the Act
in force in the Metropolitan district were extended to the United
Kingdom, and came into force on January 1st, 1855.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Died at Haddiscoe, Edward Constance, aged 68,

was laid on July 16th, 1855, by the Rev. J. Bransley, chairman of
the Board of Guardians.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A shocking accident occurred on the River Yare, near

William Plow, a lad, were drowned by the overturning of a
pleasure-boat which had gone foul of a wherry.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;The first harvest thanksgiving festival held in the
county took place at Brooke.&nbsp; It was the result of an
attempt made by the vicar, the Rev. Dr. Beal, &ldquo;to put a
stop to the disgraceful scenes which too often characterise the
close of harvest, and to the system of <i>largess</i>, which
gives rise to cases of the grossest description.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After service at the church, men, women, and children had dinner
on the vicarage lawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; observed:
&ldquo;The attempt to put an end to the system of public-house
harvest feasts, in which neither wives nor children can join,
appears in this instance to have been eminently
successful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many other villages in Norfolk, after
the harvest of 1855, followed the example set by Brooke.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The great west window at Norwich Cathedral, designed
as a memorial to Bishop Stanley, was submitted to public
inspection.&nbsp; It cost &pound;1,500, and was designed and
executed by Mr. George Hedgeland, of London.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;At the Norwich Police Court, the Rev. Henry Herring,
formerly curate of North Pickenham, was charged with begging,
under peculiar circumstances, on the previous day (Sunday), in
the Cathedral Close.&nbsp; The prisoner, &ldquo;with his gown on
his back,&rdquo; stationed himself in front of the great west
door and exhibited a placard bearing the following inscription:
&ldquo;The law ordained that they which preach the Gospel should
live by the Gospel.&nbsp; The Church of England withholds from me
the justice of that tribunal which the civil law grants to the
common murderer.&nbsp; Such is the spirit of that Church which
professedly invites even a prodigal to repentance; I have spent
&pound;1,800 in her service, and have been driven to pass three
nights in the streets of Norwich, and six nights in a lock-up (a
hole where there is only straw to lie upon on a stone floor),
solely for the want of better and proper accommodation.&nbsp; The
Mayor and magistrates have encouraged me to apply to everyone
that has a heart to feel for the miseries of a
fellow-creature.&nbsp; I earnestly solicit the sympathy and
charity of an enlightened public to enable me to live day by day
and to defend myself by law from the tyranny and persecution of
the Bishop of Norwich.&mdash;Henry Herring, late curate of North
Pickenham, Norfolk.&nbsp; Norwich Streets, September
9th.&rdquo;&nbsp; Superintendent English stated that he had <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>offered to
send the defendant to a situation in Yorkshire, or to Australia,
where his brothers resided; but he had declined to avail himself
of either.&nbsp; Mr. Herring promised not to repeat his
behaviour, and was discharged.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The opening concert of the Norfolk and Norwich
Triennial Musical Festival took place at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall.&nbsp; The programme included Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stabat
Mater,&rdquo; a selection of sacred music, and (for the first

Mozart.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; was performed on Friday
morning (15th), and in the evening a grand dress ball was given
at the Assembly Rooms, with music by Weippert&rsquo;s Royal
Quadrille Band.&nbsp; The Festival <i>artistes</i> were Madame
Angiolina Bosio, Madame Clara Novello, Madame Anaido Castellan,
Madame Weiss, Miss Dolby, Signor Gardoni, Herr Reichardt, Mr.
Sims Reeves, Signor Bolletti, Mr. Weiss, and Signor
Lablache.&nbsp; The instrumental solo performers were Mons.

<p>16.&mdash;Mr. J. H. Gurney was elected unopposed to fill the
vacancy in the representation of King&rsquo;s Lynn, created by
the death of Lord Jocelyn.</p>
<p>23.*&mdash;&ldquo;An attempt has been made at the Boar&rsquo;s
Head Inn, Surrey Street, Norwich, to originate a place of
entertainment of a similar kind to Evans&rsquo; or
Johnson&rsquo;s, in the Metropolis.&nbsp; A room capable of
seating upwards of 200 visitors has been very tastefully fitted
up by the proprietor, the walls being adorned by a series of
Norwich views exceedingly well painted by our scenic artist for
many years, Mr. Thorne, and every evening there is a vocal and
instrumental concert by parties of London professionals, who are
almost weekly changed, so as to secure as large an amount of
novelty as possible.&nbsp; Another new feature in this city is
the introduction of the imperial measure for wine at the old rate
of 2s. 6d. per pint.&rdquo;&nbsp; This place, known as &ldquo;The
Shades,&rdquo; was managed by Mr. Fred Phillips, and was the
first music hall or variety entertainment in the city.&nbsp; The
venture was not of a successful character.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;A meeting of the Norwich licensed victuallers was
held at the Boar&rsquo;s Head Inn, to protest against the Bill
for &ldquo;Regulating the Sale of Beer and other Liquors on the
Lord&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; which sought to prohibit the opening of
public-houses between the hours of 2. 30 and six o&rsquo;clock,
and after ten o&rsquo;clock on Sunday.&nbsp; The meeting decided
to petition Parliament in opposition to the measure.&nbsp; At
this meeting <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>was formed a society called the Norwich Licensed
Victuallers&rsquo; Association, of which Mr. Fred Phillips was
elected president, Mr. Plane vice-president, Mr. Cushing
treasurer, and Mr. S. Daynes secretary.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Norwich of the victory
of the allied armies at the Alma on September 20th.&nbsp; The
bells of St. Peter Mancroft were rung after service in the
afternoon.&nbsp; A fictitious message reached Norwich on the same
day (Sunday), announcing the fall of Sebastopol, and the
tricolour was hoisted on St. Peter&rsquo;s steeple.&nbsp; Regret
was afterwards expressed that facilities existed &ldquo;for
circulating such hasty and erroneous despatches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Died, at Brandon Parva, aged 100, Mary Goward,
widow.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;A remarkable discussion arose at Norwich Quarter
Sessions as to certain irregularities which were said to have
occurred at Heigham Hall private lunatic asylum.&nbsp; The
minutes of the proceedings of the visiting justices at an inquiry
held by them on June 22nd were read.&nbsp; Dr. Hull alleged that
the Rev. ---, then acting as chaplain at the Asylum, had been
wrongly admitted as a patient.&nbsp; In his evidence he stated
that in June, 1852, Mr. Nichols informed him that a country
clergyman, a member of a high county family, had committed a
rape, that his family wished to make him out to be mad, and that,
in order to save him from a criminal prosecution, they desired to
get him into a mad-house.&nbsp; Mr. Nichols requested Dr. Hull to
grant a second medical certificate.&nbsp; Dr. Hull refused to
comply.&nbsp; Mr. Nichols emphatically denied that he had used
the expressions attributed to him by Dr. Hull.&nbsp; The justices
came to the conclusion: &ldquo;(1) That the Rev. Mr. ---, by
being placed in the asylum under the circumstances disclosed in
the inquiry, was rescued from the grip of the law on a criminal
charge; (2) that the order and medical certificates upon which he
was admitted into the asylum were regular and in the form
prescribed by the Act of Parliament; (3) that in the opinion of
the visitors the Rev. Mr. --- is not a proper person to have been
appointed or to continue to officiate as chaplain to the
asylum.&rdquo;&nbsp; A letter from the office of the
Commissioners in Lunacy was read, in which they stated they were
satisfied that when the Rev. Mr. --- was admitted he was a proper
person to be placed under medical care in the asylum.&nbsp; It
was also asserted that the Commissioners had recognised him as
the chaplain of the asylum.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer, who had moved that
the licence to Heigham Hall be refused, ultimately withdrew his
motion, and the incident terminated.&nbsp; At a meeting of the
city magistrates in December, a memorial was addressed to the
Secretary of State, asking that a &ldquo;searching investigation
be made, with power to call before the Commissioners all parties
who may be able to give evidence upon the various points embraced
in the case.&rdquo;&nbsp; (No further action was taken.)</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The new bridge at Yarmouth was opened by the
chairman and members of the Haven and Pier Commission.&nbsp; The
contract price for the work of construction was &pound;24,500,
but the total cost, including the sums paid for property in the
vicinity of the bridge, was estimated at &pound;60,000.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>19.&mdash;In an &ldquo;extraordinary edition&rdquo; of
the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, published on
this date, was given a &ldquo;nominal return of the casualties

Bulwer, wounded severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The first detachment of the V Battery Royal
Artillery arrived at Norwich; and the second detachment marched

<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;The Wellington statue, erected in Norwich Market
Place, was unveiled by the Mayor (Sir Samuel Bignold) in the
presence of 20,000 spectators.&nbsp; The band of the West Norfolk
Militia played the National Anthem, and the Royal Artillery fired
a salute on the Castle Hill.&nbsp; At the luncheon given at the
Guildhall, speeches were delivered by the Earl of Orford, Lord
Ranelagh, Sir John Boileau, Lord Royston, and Mr. H. J. S.
Stracey.&nbsp; The statue cost about &pound;1,000.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The hero is represented in the identical boots, cloak, and
some other portions of dress actually worn by him at Waterloo,
which were placed at the service of Mr. Adams, the sculptor, when
he was modelling the figure.&nbsp; Mr. Adams has placed a copy of
last Saturday&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span> in a small space chiselled for the purpose under
the foot of the statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Swaffham Coursing Meeting, which had greatly
degenerated, was held, but owing to the small number of entries,
the sport concluded early in the afternoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although
it does not appear that in other places coursing meetings have
declined, it is clear that the glories of the Swaffham one have
departed.&nbsp; The loss of Mr. Richard Gurney struck a blow at
it almost fatal.&nbsp; This was followed by the withdrawal of Mr.
Hamond and others, leaving the club originally consisting of all
the letters of the alphabet reduced to two members.&nbsp;
Although disappointed by the curtailment of the sports of the
field, it was determined that the ladies should have the assembly
as usual.&nbsp; It was held on Tuesday (the 7th), but it was
known that none of the Club would be there to meet them as
heretofore.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fortunes of the Club could only be
restored, it was said, by throwing the meeting open to all
England.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Robert Chamberlin was elected Mayor, and Mr. R.
J. H. Harvey appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Mr. J. H. Tillett, it was announced on this date,
had resigned his seat in the Norwich Town Council, in consequence
of the Liberal candidate for the Seventh Ward &ldquo;being forced
upon the reluctant electors by bribery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Tillett
wrote: &ldquo;A due regard to that peace of mind which is
essential to a man&rsquo;s happiness compels me to separate
myself at once and for ever in the most decided and unequivocal
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>manner
possible from any association with those who are not prepared in
public matters to adhere to a right and honest course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died at his residence, Pedestal House, Southtown,
Yarmouth in his 89th year, Captain Manby, F.R.S., the inventor of
the apparatus for saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His life for the last fifty years had been spent in
serving his country, and his name will be revered by thousands
who would have been widows and orphans but for the successful
application of science which was perfected by his untiring
industry and perseverance.&rdquo;&nbsp; His remains were buried
at Hilgay on November 24th.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Mrs. Fanny Kemble commenced a series of Shakesperian
readings at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;A writ was received at Norwich for the election of a
member to supply the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr.
Peto, M.P., &ldquo;in consequence of the opinion of the law
officers of the Crown that though he had consented to construct a
railway in the Crimea without profit to himself, he would be
liable to heavy penalties if he continued to sit in the House of
Commons.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> December 27th.)</p>
<p>9.&mdash;A description was published of the new Corn Hall at
Diss, erected by a public-spirited resident, Mr. T. L.
Taylor.&nbsp; The building was designed by Mr. George Atkins,

the purposes of a corn market at a nominal rental, and he further
intends appropriating a spacious apartment for a reading-room and
library.&rdquo;</p>

was advertised under its new title, &ldquo;Edmonds&rsquo;, late
Wombwell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; The exhibition was removed from
its usual quarters on Castle Meadow to the Market Place.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died at his residence in Berkeley Square, Mr.
William Howe Windham, of Felbrigg Hall.&nbsp; He was one of the
representatives of the Eastern Division of Norfolk in 1832, when
he was returned with the Hon. George Keppel, their opponents
being Lord Henry Cholmondeley and Mr. Nathaniel Peach.&nbsp; In
1835 he came forward with Mr. R. H. Gurney, in opposition to Mr.
Edmond Wodehouse and Lord Walpole, when the two last named were
returned.&nbsp; In 1837 another election occurred, when Lord
Walpole having retired, Mr. H. N. Burroughes was brought forward
in conjunction with Mr. Wodehouse.&nbsp; Mr. Windham and Mr.
Gurney, who opposed them, were again unsuccessful.&nbsp; Mr.
Windham, who was a staunch Whig, was the oldest son of
Vice-Admiral Windham (formerly Lukin), who took the name and arms
in pursuance of the will of his uncle, the Right Hon. William
Windham, in 1824, on succeeding to the estate on the death of
Mrs. Windham.&nbsp; On the decease of his father, the Admiral,
Mr. Windham succeeded to the Felbrigg property.&nbsp; He married,
in 1835, Lady Sophia Hervey, daughter of the Marquis of Bristol,
by whom he had one son, then in his fourteenth year.&nbsp; Mr.
Windham died at the age of 53.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Mr. J. F. Young, who for many years afterwards was a
favourite actor in Norwich, made his first appearance at the
Theatre Royal, in <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>the character of Sir Edward Mortimer (&ldquo;The Iron
Chest&rdquo;).&nbsp; The play was followed by a pantomime,
entitled, &ldquo;Harlequin St. George, or the Geni
Czarnickholdofallhecan and the Fairy of Contentment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The West Norfolk Militia assembled at Norwich for
the annual training.&nbsp; The East Norfolk Militia were embodied
on the same day, at Yarmouth.</p>
<p>&mdash;Sir Samuel Bignold and Mr. Anthony Hamond, of Westacre,
were nominated candidates at the election at Norwich rendered
necessary by the retirement of Mr. Peto.&nbsp; A poll, demanded
on behalf of Mr. Hamond, took place on the 28th, and the result
was officially declared on the 29th, as follows: Bignold, 1,901;
Hamond, 1,635.&nbsp; After this election were published, for the
first time, the expenses of the respective candidates.&nbsp; In
Mr. Hamond&rsquo;s accounts, under the heading, &ldquo;hire of
horses and carriages,&rdquo; was the item, &ldquo;W. Slaughter,
Sedan chair, 15s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Died, the Rev. Sir George Stracey, Bart., rector of
Rackheath.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is rather a singular circumstance that
there has been but one presentation to the living of Rackheath
during a period of 115 years.&nbsp; The late rector held the
living from 1796, and his predecessor was presented to it in
1739.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;A serious railway accident occurred between Thetford
and Brandon.&nbsp; The up mail from Norwich, which left Thetford
soon after 11 p.m., was detained two and a half miles beyond the
station by a breakdown of the engine.&nbsp; Twenty-three minutes
later a cattle train, travelling at full speed, dashed into the
rear of the mail train.&nbsp; The engine-driver of the mail, John
Burton, who was at work beneath his engine, was killed instantly,
and three passengers in the rear carriage seriously
injured.&nbsp; One, Mr. Meagher, a London undertaker, who had
been attending the funeral of Mr. Windham, afterwards died.&nbsp;
At the inquest, on January 15th, 1855, the jury found that the
accident resulted from the inefficiency of the railway
company&rsquo;s rules in allowing a heavily-laden cattle train to
follow a mail train at unlimited speed without telegraphic
communication from the preceding station.</p>
<h3>1855.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The railways from Reedham to Yarmouth and Lowestoft

and held this situation for 56 years.&nbsp; He was distinguished
as an organist, and was celebrated for his pure style of playing
the old ecclesiastical compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;In consequence of the high price of provisions, the
inclemency of the weather, and the want of employment, it was
decided, at a meeting held at the Guildhall, Norwich, to start a
public subscription to aid the District Visiting Society in the
relief of the poor.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The dignity of a baronetcy was conferred on Mr.
Peto, in appreciation of his services, &ldquo;and more especially
of his disinterested and patriotic conduct in retiring from the
representation of Norwich to carry out the construction of the
railway from Balaclava, originated by the Duke of
Newcastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Died at Downham Green, Wymondham, Mr. James Neave,
aged 68, &ldquo;chairman of the market table at the Norfolk
Hotel, Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; When hundreds of small farmers in
the county were threatened with ruin after the great hailstorm,
in August, 1842, Mr. Neave suggested to his brother
agriculturists the introduction of a voluntary rate, by which
about &pound;10,000 was raised for the relief of the
sufferers.&nbsp; Subsequently was established the Norwich
Hailstorm Society, of which Mr. Neave was an active promoter.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;The Norwich police appeared in a new uniform.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The principal alteration in the clothing consists in the
substitution of a frock-coat for the unsightly long-tailed coat,
which is certainly a most becoming uniform for a civil
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>21.&mdash;This day was observed as one of solemn fasting and
humiliation, in accordance with Royal Proclamation.&nbsp; The
Mayor and Corporation of Norwich attended service at the
Cathedral, and there were numerous congregations at other places

became curate to the Rev. William Bates, rector of Burnham.&nbsp;
After two years&rsquo; service, plaintiff gave the defendant
three months&rsquo; notice of resignation.&nbsp; Mr. Bates
supplied plaintiff with testimonials, by which he obtained the
appointment of headmaster of a public school at Wymondham, in
Leicestershire.&nbsp; In subsequent correspondence with the
trustees of the school, the defendant stated he had
&ldquo;irrefragable proofs of the exceeding wickedness&rdquo; of
the plaintiff&rsquo;s character, and, he added, &ldquo;I call
upon you, in the name of all that is holy and good, to dismiss

extending over two days, the jury gave a verdict for the

Mr. Ollett, carver, of Norwich, he commenced business for himself
at Cambridge, at the age of 22.&nbsp; He was associated with Mr.

of the designs were made by Rattee himself, and submitted to
Pugin before execution.&nbsp; He carried out Mr. G. G.
Scott&rsquo;s designs for the carvings in Ely Cathedral, and by
the advice of that gentleman spent part of the year 1852 on the
Continent, where he studied the carved woodwork and artistic
wrought ironwork and sculptured stone of Quintin Matsy and the
other master spirits of Louvain and neighbouring cities.&nbsp;
Returning to England, he constructed at Ely the reredos composed
of choice stone and alabaster, highly enriched with delicate
carving and inlaid with gold and gems, forming the most glorious
piece of art workmanship executed since the Reformation.&nbsp;
His work is to be found in churches in every county in
England.</p>

was obliged to reside, no labourers being permitted to live at
Choseley.&nbsp; Thus he walked to and from his work five miles
per day, 30 miles per week, 1,560 miles per year, and the
extraordinary number of 65,520 miles during his forty-two
years&rsquo; employment.&nbsp; This circumstance might be
multiplied by numbers in England in general, and West Norfolk in
particular, showing cogent reasons for Mr. Baines&rsquo; Poor-law
Bill being made the law of the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at her residence, St. Martin-at-Palace, Norwich,
aged 38, Harriet Gurney Gordon, many years a favourite actress at

(Victoria Hall), Norwich, presided over by the Mayor, in
furtherance of the movement in favour of administrative
reform.&nbsp; An address was delivered by Mr. W. S. Lindsay,
M.P., and a resolution was adopted affirming &ldquo;that, without
wishing to exclude the aristocratic class from the position in
the public service to which their talents and patriotism may
entitle them to assert, merit is the only principle by which
appointments to public offices should be attained.&rdquo;</p>

and widow of Mr. Samuel Hoare, jun., of Hampstead, by whom he had

<p>18.&mdash;Died, at an advanced age, at Norwich, John
Osborne.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a well-known character, and for many
years drove the Yarmouth coach, and for some time the mail coach
between Norwich and Ipswich.&nbsp; The railway, however, put an
end to his vocation.&nbsp; Every morning he attended service at
the Cathedral.&nbsp; Even when he was the driver of the coach to
Yarmouth he stipulated he should have his Sunday, in order that
he might be in his accustomed place at the Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Baron Parke and a
special jury, was tried the action, Fisher <i>v.</i>
Nisbett.&nbsp; This was a will case, which excited considerable
interest on account of the large amount of property in dispute
and the number of persons concerned.&nbsp; The plaintiff was Miss
Mary Ann Fisher, and the nominal defendant Mr. Philip Blundell
Nisbett.&nbsp; The actual defendant was Mr. Richard Blundell
Nisbett.&nbsp; The question at issue was the validity of the will
of a lady named Nisbett.&nbsp; The amount in dispute was between
&pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000 in real property, and a larger
amount in personal property.&nbsp; The father of Mrs. Nisbett was
a Mr. Fisher, a banker, of Yarmouth.&nbsp; Mary Ann Fisher, the
plaintiff, was one of his daughters.&nbsp; All the children were
dead in 1854 with the exception of Mary Ann Fisher.&nbsp; In the
year 1811, when the deceased Mrs. Nisbett married, her father
settled on her the sum of &pound;10,000, and gave her during life
an annuity of &pound;500, while all that Mr. Nisbett brought was
the sum of &pound;7,000.&nbsp; In 1824 Mr. Nisbett died.&nbsp; Of
the marriage there were three sons; two had died, and at the time
of the trial the only one living was the eldest, Philip Blundell
Nisbett, a confirmed lunatic.&nbsp; In the year 1835 Mr. Fisher
died, leaving property to the amount of about
&pound;100,000.&nbsp; Mrs. Nisbett, after her father&rsquo;s
death, left the bulk of the property to Philip Blundell
Nisbett.&nbsp; There now appeared on the scene Mr. Richard
Blundell Nisbett, a son of Mr. Nisbett&rsquo;s brother, and
nephew by marriage to Mrs. Nesbitt.&nbsp; He took out a
commission of lunacy against Philip, who was found to be a
lunatic and incapable of managing his own affairs.&nbsp; Then he
endeavoured to get a commission of lunacy against Mrs. Nisbett,
but the Lord Chancellor, on receiving the report of the medical
men who examined her, dismissed the petition, with costs.&nbsp;
As soon as Mrs. Nisbett discovered the course that Richard was
pursuing, she made a new will, the effect of which was that the
property went to Miss Fisher, the plaintiff, for life, and after
her death to blood relations.&nbsp; On November 10th, 1854, Mrs.
Nisbett died suddenly, and these legal proceedings
commenced.&nbsp; After evidence had been given by medical men and
others, the Attorney-General (Sir Alexander Cockburn) who <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>appeared for
the defendant, unexpectedly withdrew from the case, and a verdict
was entered for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>21.&mdash;Died at Thorpe, in his 72nd year, Mr. Edmond
Wodehouse.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. Thomas Wodehouse, by a
daughter of Mr. Pryce Campbell, of Stackpole Court,
Pembrokeshire.&nbsp; In 1809 he married his cousin, Lucy,
daughter of the Rev. Philip Wodehouse, by whom he had four
children, two sons and two daughters.&nbsp; In 1817 he offered
himself as candidate for Norfolk, in opposition to Mr. Pratt; he
was returned, and retained his seat until the General Election in
1830.&nbsp; At that time the excitement of the Reform agitation
was at its height, which, with other circumstances, induced him
to decline a contest.&nbsp; In that year Mr. T. W. Coke
(afterwards Earl of Leicester) was returned with Sir W. J. H. B.
ffolkes.&nbsp; In 1832 Mr. Keppel and Mr. Windham were
returned.&nbsp; When the political excitement of the former
period had subsided, Mr. Wodehouse again appeared before the
constituency, and at the General Election in 1835 he and Lord
Walpole were returned, in opposition to Mr. Windham and Mr.
Richard Hanbury Gurney.&nbsp; Another General Election took place
in 1837, and Mr. Wodehouse was returned with Mr. Henry Negus
Burroughes, in opposition to the same Liberal candidates.&nbsp;
In 1842 Mr. Wodehouse and Mr. Burroughes were again elected; Sir
W. J. H. B. ffolkes, who was abroad at the time, was nominated
without his consent as the Liberal candidate.&nbsp; Both
Conservative candidates were re-elected without opposition in
1847.&nbsp; Mr. Wodehouse sat in Parliament about forty
years.&nbsp; He was a Conservative of the old school, a
Protectionist, and a zealous supporter of Sir Robert Peel until
he introduced his Free Trade measures.&nbsp; His remains were
interred at Norwich Cathedral on August 28th.</p>
<p>&mdash;At the Norwich Police Court, Mr. John Coleman,
tragedian, and temporary manager of the Theatre, preferred a
complaint against Inspector Amis, of the city police.&nbsp; On
the previous evening, he stated, a number of persons presented
themselves at the dress-box entrance <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and demanded admission with, silver
tickets.&nbsp; He informed them that the majority of places had
been taken by those who had paid, but the upper circle was open
to silver ticket holders.&nbsp; Some noise and disturbance
ensued.&nbsp; Sir William Foster came up and endeavoured to gain
an entrance, Mr. Coleman tried to prevent him, a scuffle ensued,
and the police were sent for by both parties.&nbsp; Inspector
Amis came, and Mr. Coleman directed his attention to a notice on
the play-bill that no one would be admitted to the dress circle
without a reserved seat ticket.&nbsp; Mr. Coleman asked the
inspector to remove the persons who were seeking to gain an
entrance; and they, in turn, requested the inspector to remove
Mr. Coleman.&nbsp; The officer, it was asserted, made an
unprovoked and violent assault upon Mr. Coleman, who denied that
silver ticket holders had the privilege to enter the house, and
told them that they must legally prove their right.&nbsp; He had
taken the Theatre for two nights only, at a heavy rental, there
was no arrangement in the agreement with the manager as to the
proprietors of silver tickets, and that was why he had put the
notice on the bills.&nbsp; Mr. Hudson (a magistrate) remarked
that the owners of silver tickets were owners of the Theatre, and
had a right to go in when they pleased.&nbsp; Sir William Foster
attended the Court, and stated that unless Mr. Coleman apologised
he would take proceedings against him.&nbsp; Mr. Coleman said he
was sorry if Sir William Foster had been injured (his waistcoat
was torn to ribbons), but beyond that he should make no
apology.&nbsp; The case against Amis was dismissed.&nbsp; Silver
ticket holders were admitted without opposition on the evening of
the 21st.</p>

admiration of his long-enduring gallantry, of his courage,
constancy, self-devotion, and self-possession, which may be

<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Of late years some improvements have been made
in various parts of Norwich by widening the streets, but by far
the most important and expensive has been that in London
Street.&nbsp; The improvement was badly designed, and has cost
almost as much already as the cost would have been of pulling
down one side of the street entirely.&nbsp; <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>From first to
last at least &pound;20,000 has been expended, and the whole

<p>&mdash;In the Rolls Courts Sir John Romilly gave judgment in
the case of the Norwich Yarn Company, which came before the Court
upon appeal from the Master&rsquo;s certificate.&nbsp; The
question was whether the directors of the company were entitled
to levy contributions upon shareholders, in order to pay certain
sums advanced or borrowed by them for carrying on the business of
the company, which had become insolvent.&nbsp; Originally
projected in 1833, with the view of relieving the distress which
at that time affected the poor of Norwich, the company struggled
on with increasing difficulties for sixteen years, until in 1850
it was wound up by order of the Court.&nbsp; His lordship now
discharged altogether a question of fraud on the part of the
directors.&nbsp; He was of opinion that the directors were
entitled to be allowed all sums advanced by them, with simple
interest at five per cent., and to be repaid that amount as far
as the sum in Court would extend, with payment of the costs, and
afterwards by a surplus raised by a call from the contributors in
proportion to the number of shares held by them respectively, and
that the cost of the proceedings must be borne by the estate of
the company.</p>

&ldquo;This is the only bird of the species obtained in the
county since 1842, when a pair were killed at South Walsham,
which, with one in the Norwich Museum, are all that are known to
have occurred in Norfolk.&nbsp; The one in the Museum was
obtained by the Rev. James Brown, at Limpenhoe, in the early part
of the century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>21.&mdash;At a meeting held at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, it

<p>&mdash;The new cemetery at Yarmouth was consecrated by the
Right Rev. Bishop Spencer, acting for the Lord Bishop of the
Diocese.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;An inquiry was opened at Yarmouth by Mr. W. D.
Boase, one of her Majesty&rsquo;s Charity Commissioners,
&ldquo;into the present circumstances and administration of the
various endowed charities existing in the borough, with the view

inquiry concluded on the 24th.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A performance of Costa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eli&rdquo; was
given by the Norwich Choral Society, at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall.&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Madame Rudersdorff, Miss

Thomas.&nbsp; A performance of the same oratorio, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>under the
personal direction of the composer, had already been advertised
by Mr. Gedge, of Heigham Grove.&nbsp; The Mayor (Mr. J. G.
Johnson) had given permission for the use of the hall, and his
action was sharply criticised at the meetings of the Town Council
and in letters to the newspapers.&nbsp; The following
announcement was published on July 19th:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Eli,&rsquo; for the benefit of the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital, under the direction of Mr. Costa.&nbsp;
Postponed.&nbsp; Mr. Gedge respectfully informs the public of the
county and city that, as the Town Council has thought fit to set
aside the Mayor&rsquo;s prerogative and fixing a day for the
performance in opposition to the one he announced under the early
sanction and promise of the Mayor for the Assize week, in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and as the Council thought fit, at their
last meeting, to determine on other restrictive demands, of which
he received a legal notice this day, he has resolved to postpone
&lsquo;Eli,&rsquo; under Mr. Costa&rsquo;s direction, until a
future opportunity, when he trusts he shall be able to benefit
the charities and at the same time to gratify the
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;On this date was published a report of the action,
Beaven <i>v.</i> Lord Hastings, heard before the Vice-Chancellor,
Sir W. P. Wood.&nbsp; This was a bill by a bond creditor of
Edward Astley, deceased, praying an account of the sum due for
principal and interest upon his bond, and a decree for payment
against the defendant, Lord Hastings, on the ground that he had
made himself personally liable to pay the debt without regard to
a sufficiency of the assets of the late Edward Astley.&nbsp; The
bill also brought the declaration that the defendant had
constituted himself executor <i>de son tort</i> of the intestate
Edward Astley, and was accountable on that footing to the
plaintiff as the rightful administrator of the intestate.&nbsp;
Mr. Astley, who resided at Eneilles, in Belgium, having borrowed
&pound;1040 from the plaintiff, gave his bond, dated July 3rd,
1845, by which he became bound to the plaintiff in the penal sum
of &pound;2,080, with the condition for defeasance upon payment
on July 3rd, 1847, of &pound;1,040 with interest at 5 per
cent.&nbsp; A warrant of attorney at even date was executed by
Edward Astley, but no judgment was ever actually entered up under
the warrant.&nbsp; In April, 1846, the dead body of Edward Astley
was found, with marks of violence upon it, in the River Ourthe in
Belgium.&nbsp; Lord Hastings and his mother, Dame Hester Astley,
his sole next-of-kin, proceeded to Eneilles with his solicitor,
and applied to the Juges de Paix to remove the seals and give him
possession of his brother&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; A
<i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i> having been signed, possession of the
property, &ldquo;without description or inventory,&rdquo; was
delivered to Lord Hastings, who, by thus taking possession <i>pur
et simple</i> became personally liable, according to the Belgian
law, to pay the debts of the intestate, without reference to the
value of assets.&nbsp; The Vice-Chancellor dismissed the bill, on
the ground that the defendant, who had legally received the
property in Belgium, could not be sued in England as executor
<i>de son tort</i>.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;General Windham was received in Norwich with a great
demonstration of welcome, on his return to his native

Windham Testimonial Fund, presented the General with a service
sword and a dress sword.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;Several deaths were reported to have occurred from
small-pox at Lynn.&nbsp; &ldquo;In no instance has death ensued
here after vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;It was reported that at the Suffolk Assizes, at
Ipswich, an action was brought by the Commissioners of Yarmouth
Harbour, in the name of their clerk (Mr. Preston), pursuant to
the direction of the Master of the Rolls, against the Norfolk and
Eastern Counties Railway Company.&nbsp; The plaintiff complained
that the defendants had wrongfully diverted and obstructed the
waters of the Yare, the Wensum, and the Waveney, which of right
ought to flow into and through Yarmouth Harbour, and had turned
them into Lake Lothing, and thence into the sea through Lowestoft
Harbour.&nbsp; The Eastern Union, the Norfolk, and the Eastern
Counties Railways, had entered into an agreement for
amalgamation, by virtue of which the latter company assumed the
entire control over the network of railways constructed by those
companies and the East Anglian Company, and, among other matters,
they undertook the duties created by the Norwich and Lowestoft
Navigation Act, one of which was the maintenance of Mutford
Bridge where Lake Lothing joined Oulton Broad, for the double
purpose of keeping in the fresh waters of the Yare and Waveney
and preserving them for the use of Yarmouth Harbour, and of
keeping out the waters of the sea, which would otherwise flood
all the low lands at high water.&nbsp; These duties had not been
discharged to the satisfaction of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; After
discussion, terms of reference to Mr. B. Andrew, Q.C., were
arranged, the defendants undertaking to repair the locks at once,
the plaintiffs being let in to complain of acts of omission as
well as of commission on the part of the defendants.&nbsp; A
verdict was then taken for the plaintiffs, subject to a special
case.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 26th, 1858.)</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Lieut.-Col. Edwin Wodehouse, C.B., Royal Artillery,
on revisiting his former home at Hingham, after his return from
the Crimea, was presented with an address by the inhabitants of
the town.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Admiral Wodehouse.&nbsp;
At Inkerman a battery called &ldquo;Wodehouse&rsquo;s
Battery&rdquo; was furiously attacked and nearly all the men cut
down by overpowering numbers of the enemy.&nbsp; By heroic
courage and determination he rescued from the enemy the three
guns lost early in the action.&nbsp; Two slugs passed through his
cloak, and one, if not two, horses were killed under him.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The London Grand Opera Company commenced a season at

<p>26.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, the Paving
Committee reported in favour of a scheme for draining the
northern part of the city, at the total cost of &pound;7,893,
according to plans prepared by Mr. E. E. Benest, city
surveyor.&nbsp; The Council declined to adopt the scheme, on the
ground that the city could not afford to undertake it.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;A storm of great severity occurred.&nbsp; The
district in which it was most felt was across the track of marsh
land lying between Bungay and Ormesby.&nbsp; At Yarmouth the
outbreak began at six p.m., and lasted till midnight.&nbsp;
Several cottages were flooded, and one fell, in consequence of
its being undermined by the water.</p>
<p>&mdash;The first meeting of the provisional committee for

Hotel, under the presidency of Sir E. H. K. Lacon, Bart.,
M.P.&nbsp; The estimated cost was &pound;3,900.&nbsp; The pier

and Signor Pilotti.</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;During the past fortnight the catch of
herrings at Yarmouth has been almost unprecedented in the annals
of the fisheries.&nbsp; In many instances the boats have entered
the harbour so heavily laden that their gunwales were almost
level with the water.&nbsp; In the last ten days it is computed
that the quantity of herrings brought in and landed here from the
various boats has reached the enormous daily average of 100
lasts, or 1,320,000 fish.&nbsp; From &pound;12 10s. to &pound;14
per last has been realised; but in some cases this abundance of
fish has proved most disastrous to the owners, entailing the loss
of the boats&rsquo; nets, stores, &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. J. T.
Frosdick has sustained in this way the entire loss of the nets of
two boats, to the serious extent of &pound;450, for, owing to the
enormous catch of fish, the men were quite unable to draw the
nets on board, and ultimately the weight proved so great that
they sunk the nets and all to the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The festival of the Choir Benevolent Fund was held
at Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp; In addition to those of Norwich,
choirs from London, Ely, Cambridge, Rochester, Peterborough, and

<p>1.&mdash;Died, in his 83rd year, the Rev. James Brown, B.D.,
Hon. Canon of Norwich, and for fifty years vicar of St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;For more than twenty years
chaplain of the county prison, he was one of the earliest
advocates of educational efforts being directed towards
prisoners, and in his practical suggestions may be traced the
germ of much that is valuable in our reformatory
institutions.&nbsp; He lived long enough to see similar views
generally adopted and made compulsory by the State.&nbsp; His
duties as chaplain were performed during a period when capital
punishments were much more frequent than now, and this gave him
the opportunity of seeing vice in its most degrading forms, and
to hear from the lips of its victims the repentance which the
certain approach of death and judgment generally extracted from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The church of the Holy Trinity, Hempton Green, was
opened by the Bishop of Norwich.</p>
<p>&mdash;The corner-stone of the new Corn Hall at Aylsham was

<p>16.&mdash;The Earl of Albemarle addressed a large meeting of
the industrial class at the Corn Hall, Diss, upon the subject of
&ldquo;Benefit Clubs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of his remarks,
he asserted &ldquo;the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows is humbug
from beginning to end.&rdquo;&nbsp; The action of his lordship
evoked a large amount of newspaper correspondence, and on
November 6th Mr. Samuel Daynes, a former &ldquo;Grand
Master&rdquo; of the Unity, introduced at Diss a Mr. Reeve, who
delivered an address to rebut the assertions of Lord
Albemarle.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Mr. Fred Phillips&rsquo; dramatised version of Mrs.
Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s romance of &ldquo;Dred&rdquo; was produced
at the Surrey Theatre, and was favourably noticed by the

the bank by the side of the line, and, after running forty yards,
turned over upon its side, crushing the driver to death.&nbsp;
The accident was occasioned by the breaking of the tire of the
leading wheel of the engine.&nbsp; A few minutes after the
accident a goods up-train ran into the tender of the disabled
engine, but only a slight collision resulted.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Mr. Robert Chamberlin was elected Mayor, and Mr.

<p>13.&mdash;A sculling match, for &pound;100, between Henry
Kelly, of Fulham, and Richard Buttle, of Norwich, was rowed on
the Thames, from Putney to Mortlake.&nbsp; Kelly won, by little
more than half a boat&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; Time, 25
minutes.&nbsp; The return match was fixed to take place on the
Yare, from Surlingham to Thorpe, on November 25th, but owing to a
dispute as to the appointment of referee, the race was postponed
until the 26th, when Kelly, who rowed the distance, about
4&frac12; miles, in 37&frac12; minutes, won easily.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Died, the Right Hon. Julia Barbara, Lady Stafford,

went ashore at Yarmouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The beach presented a
melancholy appearance, from the number of vessels upon

wings 8 feet.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A dinner was held at the Angel Inn, North Walsham,
to celebrate the restoration of the Market Cross.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at his residence, Park Crescent, London, in his
70th year, the Hon. Sir Edward Hall Alderson, Baron of her
Majesty&rsquo;s Court of Exchequer.&nbsp; He was the eldest son
of Mr. Robert Alderson, barrister-at-law, and Recorder of
Norwich, by the daughter of Mr. Samuel Hurry, of Great Yarmouth,
where he was born in 1787.&nbsp; He received his early education
at the Charter House and at Caius College, Cambridge.&nbsp;
Elected a Fellow of his college, he, in 1812, proceeded
M.A.&nbsp; On being called to the Bar, he went the Northern
Circuit.&nbsp; In conjunction with Mr. Barnewell, he edited five
volumes of reports of cases heard in the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench between 1815 and 1820.&nbsp; In 1830, though still wearing
the stuff gown, he was promoted an additional puisne judge in the
Court of Common Pleas, and received the honour of
knighthood.&nbsp; In 1834 he was transferred from that Court to a
puisne judgeship in the Court of Exchequer, where for many years
he was second to Baron Parke.&nbsp; Baron Alderson was a careful,
learned, and conscientious judge, though his mind was naturally
inclined to take a rather hard and dry view of the question at
issue, and to strip it, almost to a fault, of extraneous
matter.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;A singular action for defamation of character was
tried before Mr. Justice Williams and a special jury in the Court
of Common Pleas.&nbsp; Mr. Stephen English, Chief Constable of
Norwich, was the plaintiff, and Capt. Black, Chief Constable of
Norfolk, the defendant.&nbsp; The damages were laid at
&pound;3,000.&nbsp; According to the opening statement of Mr.
Serjeant Byles, Capt. Black felt himself aggrieved that Mr.
English should be styled Chief Constable of Norwich, and wrote to
the Watch Committee several letters upon the subject, stating
that Mr. English&rsquo;s assumed title, instead of his proper
title, &ldquo;superintendent of police,&rdquo; had caused him
(Capt. Black) obstruction and official inconvenience in the
discharge of his duties.&nbsp; These letters had no effect, and
Capt. Black then published handbills reflecting upon the <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>personal
character of Mr. English.&nbsp; He stated that the antecedents of
Mr. English in relation to other county forces were so
disreputable as to cause his expulsion from more than one of
them.&nbsp; This was the defamatory statement complained
of.&nbsp; Many witnesses were examined on both sides, and on the
29th the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages
&pound;50.&nbsp; On February 13th Sir Henry Stracey, M.P., in
Committee on the Chief Constables Bill, moved to insert in clause
4, &ldquo;And whereas disputes having arisen as to the title of
Chief Constable, for avoiding the same the title of Chief
Constable shall be exclusively applicable to and borne by the
officer appointed by the justices of any county in General or
Quarter Sessions assembled, and the title Head Constable by the
officer appointed by the Watch Committees of boroughs and
cities.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;A servant girl, named Belinda Wilson, aged 18, was
charged at the County Police Station, Norwich, with stealing, on
January 3rd the sum of &pound;90, in bank notes, the property of
her master, Mr. William Claxton, farmer, of Stoke Holy
Cross.&nbsp; After taking the money, Wilson attired herself in
the clothes of a manservant, and starting from Flordon railway
station, proceeded to Edinburgh, where she had some difficulty in
obtaining change, as English notes were not in general
circulation there.&nbsp; She obtained a new suit of clothes of
sporting cut, and travelled from place to place &ldquo;like a
fast young man.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the end of January she was again
in the Eastern Counties, and took up her abode at Yarmouth.&nbsp;
During a visit to Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie, she was recognised
by an old schoolfellow, through whom information was given to the
police, who apprehended her at the Waterloo Tavern, St.
Peter&rsquo;s Road, where she was posing as &ldquo;a
lively-looking youth, and smoking a cigar.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave
the name of James Smith.&nbsp; The prisoner was committed for
trial, and at the Norfolk Quarter Sessions in March pleaded
guilty, and was sentenced by Sir Willoughby Jones to two
years&rsquo; imprisonment, with hard labour.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The new Corn Hall at East Dereham, erected on the
sites of old shambles and slaughter-houses, was opened.&nbsp; A
company of 250 guests assembled at dinner in the hall, under the

Leicester, Lord Walsingham, Lord Hastings, Lord Suffield, the
Hon. and Rev. E. S. Keppel, Mr. W. Bagge, M.P., Mr. G. P.
Bentinck, M.P., Mr. E. Fellowes, M.P., the Mayor and Sheriff of
Norwich, &amp;c.&nbsp; The hall was built by a company, with a
capital of &pound;3,000.&nbsp; Its cost was about &pound;1,800;

Norwich, received by the London post a letter enclosing the
halves of notes to the amount of &pound;140, with the intimation,
written in a disguised hand, that about 14 years ago the writer,
being in a place of trust in his establishment, had appropriated
to himself this amount in a dishonest manner, and taken the
present opportunity of returning it.&nbsp; On Friday morning came
the other halves of the notes, with the request that the rest of
the money might be acknowledged in the &lsquo;Daily

Court, before Mr. T. J. Birch.&nbsp; Mr. John Cobb sued Mr. G. D.
Palmer and Mr. W. N. Burroughes for the recovery of certain money
paid by the plaintiff at the request of the defendants for
expenses incurred in contesting an election of councillors for
the Market Ward in that borough on November 1st, 1851.&nbsp; Mr.
Cobb was induced, on the solicitation of the defendants, who were
leaders of the Liberal party, to offer himself as a candidate for
the Market Ward.&nbsp; He was not anxious to become a councillor,
but the defendants promised to &ldquo;see him through,&rdquo; and
on the night before the election distinctly guaranteed him that
he should be reimbursed any outlay incurred beyond the sum of
&pound;10.&nbsp; Mr. Cobb was defeated at the poll.&nbsp; It was
not denied that the guarantee was given, but it was contended
that, in order to render it valid to support the action, it
should have been in writing, which it was not.&nbsp; The Judge
concurred, and nonsuited the plaintiff.&nbsp; It was admitted, in
the course of the hearing, that the money was applied &ldquo;to
bribery, vulgarly so-called.&rdquo;</p>

application of Mr. Power, a bench warrant for his
lordship&rsquo;s apprehension was issued.&nbsp; On April 1st Mr.
Kent, solicitor, appeared on behalf of Lord Hastings, and applied

&pound;200 and two sureties of &pound;100 each.&nbsp; The Earl of
Leicester and Lord Suffield were his sureties.&nbsp; The case was
traversed to the next Assizes.&nbsp; Further proceedings were,
however, withdrawn, after an interview between Lieut.-Col. Astley
and Mr. Tillett.&nbsp; &ldquo;His lordship,&rdquo; it was stated
&ldquo;had no intention of sending a threatening or offensive
message to Mr. Tillett, and he felt that an article published by
Mr. Tillett on November 29th, 1856, was an unjustifiable attack
upon him, which led to the warmth exhibited by his lordship in
his interview with Mr. Tillett, for which his lordship expresses
regret and withdraws his offensive epithets.&nbsp; Mr. Tillett,
upon his lordship&rsquo;s disavowal, withdraws any remarks
offensive to his lordship is the article above alluded to, and

America.&nbsp; He has also an increase in a young kangaroo and
three young nylgaus having been born the week before last at
Melton Constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The chancel of East Dereham church was re-opened, after
&ldquo;additional embellishment, through the liberality of the
sinecure rector, the Rev. W. C. Wollaston.&rdquo;&nbsp; The open
roof was displayed by the removal of an unsightly ceiling, early
English windows were substituted for those of more debased style,
and a window by Wailes, as a memorial to Mrs. Wollaston,
completed the series of stained glass windows.&nbsp; The reredos
was illuminated by Messrs. King, of Norwich.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;At Docking Petty Sessions it was stated, during the
hearing of a case of assault, that the quarrel had its origin in
a belief in witchcraft, &ldquo;unfortunately too prevalent in
most of the country villages.&rdquo;&nbsp; The witnesses
&ldquo;displayed a great amount of ignorance and superstition, <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>showing how
the husband of the complainant had been bewitched and unable to
move for twelve months, but was cured in two days by a witch

exhibited in a field belonging to Mr. Craske Roper, of Croxton
Park, near Thetford.&nbsp; Two engines, fitted with an
&ldquo;endless railway,&rdquo; were built by Mr. Burrell, of
Thetford, and both were shown at work.&nbsp; &ldquo;The new
engine is like a railway locomotive, but with the addition of an
apparatus, which answers the purpose of a railway, attached to
the wheels.&nbsp; The endless railway consists of a series of
flat boards, six in number, plated with iron on both sides of
each wheel, equal in length to the radius of the wheel, and from
10 to 16 inches in width, loosely attached to the felloe of the
wheel in such a manner that they are carried round with it as it
revolves.&nbsp; Each in succession is laid flat on the ground in
front of the wheel, and lifted up in its rear as soon as passed
over.&nbsp; On the surface of the boards next the periphery of
the wheel an iron rail is fixed, on which the wheel runs, the
boards thus corresponding to the sleepers of an ordinary railway,
so that the wheels carry their own rails and sleepers with them,
laying down a literally endless railway whenever they are set in
motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A meeting was held in the old Library Room, St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, &ldquo;to take into consideration
the expediency of forming a society to prevent persons from
taking and destroying fish by illegal practices.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was resolved, &ldquo;That an anglers&rsquo; society be
established in Norwich, with the view of aiding the authorities
in preventing illegal fishing, and also for promoting the

Society,&rdquo; and Mr. Skippon was appointed honorary
secretary.</p>

Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich.&nbsp; The subject was,
&ldquo;George the Third.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second lecture was
delivered on the 15th, and was entitled, &ldquo;George the
Fourth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A very general feeling of
disappointment is expressed at the style and manner of the
lecturer, and at the very high prices charged (4s. and 2s.
6d.).&nbsp; We have reason to believe that in some instances
those who paid for tickets for the second evening intentionally
absented themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Letters were published in the
<span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> expressing strong
disapproval of Thackeray&rsquo;s strictures upon the personal
characters of the Georges.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The polling for the election of a Coroner for the
Lynn district, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr.
George Sayle, commenced at Lynn.&nbsp; The candidates were Mr.
Jeffery and Mr. Wilkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;An extraordinary degree of
energy was displayed in bringing up the voters in all parts of
the district, and the expenses incurred in paying railway and
coach fares, breakfasts, and dinners for the voters and hangers
on (to say nothing of the sum of money lavished in other ways to
obtain their suffrages, added to the usual outlay upon a
contested election), must have amounted to something enormous, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>considering
the pecuniary value of the office at stake, probably at the best
averaging &pound;25 or &pound;30 a year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poll
closed on the 19th, when Mr. Wilkin was declared elected.</p>

Yare, from Surlingham to Whitlingham (3&frac12; miles), between
Stephen Wright, of Norwich, aged 22, and J. H. Clasper, of
Newcastle, aged 18.&nbsp; The former was trained by John
Britcher, and the latter by his father.&nbsp; Clasper&rsquo;s
boat was the lighter by several pounds, and in length exceeded
the Norwich man&rsquo;s craft by about four feet.&nbsp; Wright
had the better of the start, but in ten strokes Clasper led by a
quarter of a length.&nbsp; At Bramerton, however, Wright obtained
a clear lead, and at Wood&rsquo;s End led by four lengths.&nbsp;
Clasper made a desperate spurt, and got nearly abreast of his
antagonist, who won by a length, in 23&frac12; minutes.&nbsp; The
Newcastle man suffered severely from exhaustion, and was lifted
from his boat in a helpless condition.&nbsp; The return match was
rowed on the Tyne, on July 24th, when Wright again won.</p>

letter to the editor of the &lsquo;Morning
Post&rsquo;:&mdash;&lsquo;Sir, I enclose you a paragraph which
appeared in your paper of the 21st inst., to the truth of which I
desire you to give the most emphatic denial.&nbsp; It is a
<i>rechauff&eacute;</i> of the lie circulated some thirty years
since in a London journal as a hoax, I presume, on the
editor.&nbsp; At the time I did not think it worthy of
contradiction, nor at my age should I deem it worthy of any such
contradiction now, but am solely induced to do so for the
satisfaction of those most justly dear to me.&mdash;Yours,
&amp;c., <span class="smcap">Orford</span>.&nbsp; May 26th,
1857.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (The paragraph here alluded to is the
much-quoted reply purported to have been sent by the noble lord
to the secretary of the Norwich Bible Society.&nbsp; It
originally appeared in the &ldquo;Freemen&rsquo;s Journal,&rdquo;
Dublin.)</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Died at his residence, Brighton, Mr. Charles Edmund

valuable work he had done for the Order.</p>
<p>1.&mdash;Died at Costessey, aged 88, Mr. John Culley, one of
the leading agriculturists of the county.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was to
him and a few others that the farmers in this locality are
indebted for the establishment of the Hail Storm Society, and the
subscriptions which followed the memorable hailstorm in this
county a few years since.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Culley took a
prominent part in the movement for the erection of the Norwich
Corn Exchange.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A familiar object, known as the &ldquo;Bassingham
Gateway,&rdquo; in London Street, Norwich, was sold by
auction.&nbsp; The purchaser was Mr. William Wilde, and the price
&pound;12.&nbsp; The hope was expressed that this relic of
antiquity would not be removed from the city.&nbsp; On September
5th it was announced: &ldquo;The Bassingham Gateway has been
erected at the magistrates&rsquo; entrance at the Guildhall,
where it is quite out of character with the building, or, at any
rate, that part of it.&nbsp; Above the gate are the arms of Henry
VII., the arms of the Goldsmiths&rsquo; Company, to which its
builder, Mr. John Bassingham, belonged, and of the city of
Norwich.&nbsp; Having been cleaned, the carved work is brought
out in bold relief.&rdquo;</p>

his favour.</p>
<p>13.*&mdash;&ldquo;The Marine Parade (Yarmouth) may now be
looked upon as completed, and certainly in almost every
particular it has exceeded the expectations formed of it.&nbsp;
It was planned and carried out under the immediate
superintendence of the Town Surveyor, Mr. A. W. Morant, and the
cost will not exceed the sum estimated, &pound;1,700.&rdquo;</p>
<p>16.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council,
the Grammar School Committee reported that the hearing took
place, before the Master of the Rolls, on June 10th, of the suit,
the Attorney-General <i>v.</i> Hudson, when the principal
differences which had existed in reference to the new scheme for
the administration of the School and Hospital had been amicably
adjusted.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;1,000 per annum, exclusive of
the cost of buildings, was to be taken from the Great Hospital
funds and appropriated, under the management of separate
trustees, to the purposes of education.&nbsp; Two schools were to
be established&mdash;a Grammar School and a Commercial
School.&nbsp; The course of instruction in the Grammar School
would embrace English, Latin, French, and German, &amp;c., and in
the Commercial School, English, French, and the rudiments of
Latin, &amp;c.&nbsp; Prizes and scholarships were to be given to
both schools, and the boy who obtained an upper class scholarship
in the Commercial School would be entitled to education in the
Grammar School without cost.&nbsp; The payments for boys educated
in the Grammar School were to range from 6 gs. to 8 gs. per year,
and in the Commercial School 30s. per year.&nbsp; The masters
were to be paid a fixed salary, besides which their <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>stipends
would be augmented in the Grammar School by four-sixths of the
money received from the pupils, and in the Commercial School by
three-sixths.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 23rd, 1858.)</p>

the Hon. George Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the troops in
India.&nbsp; He was the second son of Thomas, first Viscount
Anson, and brother of the first Earl of Lichfield, served in the
Scots Fusilier Guards, and was present at the battle of
Waterloo.&nbsp; In 1818 he was returned for Yarmouth, and
represented the borough in several Parliaments before and after
the passing of the Reform Bill.&nbsp; By hereditary descent and
by personal conviction he was a Liberal in politics, and
invariably sided with the leaders of the Whig party.&nbsp; He
became Major-General on November 11th, 1851.&nbsp; He was a
zealous patron of the Turf, on which he was better known as

<p>4.&mdash;Application was made in the Court of Chancery, before
the Lord Chancellor, for a re-hearing of the case, Lombe
<i>v.</i> Stoughton, which was decided in the year 1841, by the
then Vice-Chancellor.&nbsp; The testator, Sir John Lombe, had
left a large fund, to be applied to the purpose of building a
mansion on his estate in Norfolk, with a direction that the fund
should accumulate until the house was finished.&nbsp;
Considerable delay took place in completing the house, and the
fund increased to a very large amount, leaving a surplus of about
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; The Vice-Chancellor directed the fund to be
applied to building purposes at a time when it was not known that
the surplus would be so large, but the order was made without
prejudice to any question as to the surplus.&nbsp; This surplus
was now claimed by the representatives of the successive tenants
for life, on the ground that they (the tenants for life) had been
deprived of the enjoyment of the house, and were, therefore,
entitled to the fund by way of compensation.&nbsp; The Lord
Chancellor gave leave for the Vice-Chancellor to re-hear the
case, if he found himself fettered by the wording of <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the
decree.&nbsp; The Vice-Chancellor, on July 31st, ruled that what
had been done was according to the intention of the testator, and
held that the surplus must be considered as capital, and not
income.</p>

hearing of a petition lodged by Mr. Richard Ferrier, the elder,
and Mr. E. H. L. Preston, against the return for Yarmouth of the
sitting members, Messrs. M&rsquo;Cullagh and Watkin.&nbsp;
Bribery, treating, and undue influence were alleged.&nbsp; The
inquiry lasted five days.&nbsp; On July 29th the Committee found
that Messrs. M&rsquo;Cullagh and Watkin were, by their agents,
guilty of bribery, that they were not duly elected burgesses to
serve in Parliament, that the election was a void election, and
bribes had been paid.&nbsp; On August 10th, Mr. Adolphus William
Young and Mr. John Mellor, Q.C., Liberals, were returned without
opposition.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Campbell, an indictment was preferred against the East Dereham
Corn Exchange Company, for obstructing a certain highway over
Lion Hill in that town by the erection of the hall, and further
for obstructing Quebec Street and certain fairs and
markets.&nbsp; The jury, after a long hearing, returned a verdict
for the Crown, with the rider: &ldquo;We find that there was a
public highway over Lion Hill, and we find that there is an
obstruction of that part occupied by the Corn Exchange Company,
but we find that the public are materially benefited by the
alteration, and on the second count we find for the
defendants.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> May 5th, 1858.)</p>

<p>15.*&mdash;&ldquo;A report is going the round of the papers,
copied from the Australian journals, regarding the death of the
person known to our readers as Emily Sandford.&nbsp; We are
assured by a gentleman who interested himself in her behalf in

Anthony Hudson, banker, aged 75.&nbsp; In early life he enjoyed
the friendship of the Right Hon. William Windham, and had since
been on intimate terms with the Windham family.&nbsp; For many
years he took an active part in the management of the bank of
Messrs. Harveys and Hudsons.&nbsp; After the passing of the
Municipal Reform Bill, he was appointed a magistrate of the city,

destitute.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was decided to open a public
subscription.</p>

68</span>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>7.&mdash;By Royal Proclamation this day was observed as one of
humiliation and prayer.&nbsp; At Norwich all the principal shops
were closed, and services were held morning and evening at the
parish churches.&nbsp; Collections were made on behalf of the
sufferers by the Indian Mutiny.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Mr. W. H. Russell, LL.D., the special correspondent
of &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; during the Crimean War, delivered, at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, a lecture on the principal
events of the campaign.&nbsp; He gave a second lecture on the
23rd.</p>
<p>&mdash;A terrible storm raged on the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; The
brig Ontario, of South Shield&rsquo;s, from Newcastle to Suez
with coals (Capt., Balfour), foundered on the Barber Sand off
Yarmouth, and drifting to the Cockle Gatway, was lost.&nbsp; The
captain, his wife and son, and the crew of 24 hands
perished.&nbsp; The chief mate, William Coates Robinson, alone
escaped.&nbsp; The Zillah, of Whitby, from Hartlepool to London,
commanded by Capt. Watson, was lost off Winterton, and five men,
including the master, were drowned, out of the crew of eight
hands.&nbsp; Upon the Norfolk coast between forty and fifty lives
were lost.&nbsp; It was asserted that many lives would have been
saved had the lifeboats and apparatus been in an ordinarily
effective condition.&nbsp; The strictures made upon the
life-saving service led to negotiations for the amalgamation with
the National Society of the Norfolk Association for Saving the
Lives of Shipwrecked Mariners.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;A troop of the 15th Hussars left Norwich for
Coventry.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Mr. Cadge was elected surgeon of the Norfolk and

<p>20.&mdash;Miss P. Horton (Mrs. German Reed) and Mr. T. German
Reed gave their entertainment at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened for the winter
season.&nbsp; Mr. Sidney doubled the prices of admission to pit
and gallery, and increased the prices of the dress and upper
boxes.&nbsp; Tuesdays and Fridays were set apart as
&ldquo;subscription nights,&rdquo; for the production of
high-class plays and dramas.&nbsp; The manager intimated that the
hire of silver tickets was illegal, &ldquo;the Theatre deed
requiring legal transfer and register with the proprietors&rsquo;
solicitor to be available for admission.&rdquo;&nbsp; A printed
circular had been issued by a speculator, offering silver tickets
for hire for the night, week, or the whole season, &ldquo;on the
usual terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;An alarming accident occurred in a building erected
for equestrian performances at the Orchard Gardens,
Norwich.&nbsp; Soon after the commencement of the entertainment,
the supports of the gallery gave way, and the structure fell,
with between 300 and 400 <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>persons.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole mass
of timber fell under the people, who, with their seats, were
thrown outwards, rolling over one another.&nbsp; Strange to say,
nobody was killed, no legs or arms broken, and nobody seriously
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The Wells and Fakenham Railway was opened.&nbsp; In
1853 the company was formed, with a capital of &pound;70,000,
&pound;14,000 of which was contributed by the inhabitants of
Wells, &pound;10,000 by the Earl of Leicester, and &pound;30,000
by the Norfolk Railway Company.&nbsp; Mr. G. Berkeley, of Great
George Street, Westminster, was the engineer, and Mr. Solomon
Treadwell the contractor.&nbsp; The opening-day was observed in
the district as a general holiday.&nbsp; A special train was run
over the nine and a half miles of line, the Earl of Leicester
entertained a large party at Holkham, and in the evening his
lordship presided over a public dinner, held at the Crown Inn,
Wells.</p>
<p>5.*&mdash;&ldquo;Norwich manufactures at present may be said
to be almost at a standstill.&nbsp; There has not been so
complete a state of stagnation for some years past.&nbsp;
Hundreds of operatives who are usually employed at this season in
the production of spring goods are now out of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Alexander Hugh Baring was returned without
opposition member of Parliament for the borough of Thetford, on
the retirement of his father from the representation of the
constituency.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;A sculling match, for &pound;10 a side, was rowed
from Postwick Hall to Whitlingham Point, between John Wright and
Lancaster.&nbsp; The former won easily.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council adopted a motion in favour
of the erection of a new Fishmarket.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The West Norfolk Militia, which assembled on
November 10th, 600 strong, left Norwich by rail for garrison
duty.&nbsp; The headquarters and three companies, under the
command of Lieut.-Col. Custance, proceeded to Chester; three
companies, commanded by Major Bedingfeld, to Liverpool; and two
companies, commanded by Capt. Marsham, to Stockport.&nbsp; The
regiment returned to Norwich on April 23rd, 1858.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The pantomime at Norwich Theatre was entitled,
&ldquo;Harlequin Sinbad the Sailor, or the Princess with the
Diamond Eyes and the Fairy of the Island of Jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1858.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;A fire, involving the destruction of several
dwelling-houses and a large amount of other property, originated
on the premises of Mr. W. Colby, fish merchant, St. James&rsquo;s
Place, South End, Yarmouth.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>5.&mdash;The premises of Mr. H. F. Butcher, paper and
mill-board manufacturer, St. Martin-at-Palace, Norwich, were
destroyed by fire.&nbsp; On the same day a fire occurred at Mr.
Orfeur&rsquo;s timber-yard, St. Edmund&rsquo;s; and on the 6th an
outbreak took place at the soap manufactory of Messrs. Andrews
and French, in Fishgate Street.&nbsp; The loss occasioned by the
three fires amounted to upwards of &pound;6,000.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Norwich of the defeat of
General Windham and his division by the Gwalier mutineers, near
Cawnpore, on November 27th.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Miss P. Horton and Mr. T. German Reed appeared at the
Assembly Rooms, Norwich.&nbsp; These favourite performers made a
return visit on October 27th, with their entertainments,
&ldquo;After the Ball&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Unfinished
Opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, Mr. J. H.
Tillett moved, &ldquo;That an inquiry be held respecting the
manner in which appointments to the city magistracy are made, and
also the manner in which the magisterial business of this city is
conducted, with the view to the adoption of any measures which
may appear likely to promote the better administration of
justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was adopted.&nbsp; The committee
of inquiry reported in February that they considered &ldquo;the
mode in which the magistracy is appointed in cities and boroughs
is highly objectionable, the appointments being the result of
party influence,&rdquo; and recommended for the magistracy
&ldquo;those gentlemen who have served the office of Mayor to the
satisfaction of the Council.&rdquo;&nbsp; Complaints were made
that from excitement or infirmity of temper certain gentlemen
made use of language derogatory to their position, and tending to
lower the respect of the Bench, and these complaints the
Committee found were not groundless.&nbsp; On March 16th the Town
Council adopted a series of resolutions, requesting the Mayor to
address a letter to those gentlemen whose names appeared in the
report as having never attended petty sessions, or as having
rarely or sometimes attended, requiring them to take upon
themselves to discharge the duties of their office; that a rota
of attendance be established; and that, &ldquo;in relation to the
unseemly proceedings which have taken place in the Sword Room,
the Council forbear to memorialise the Lord Chancellor on the
subject, in the hope that similar proceedings will not occur
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The marriage of the Princess Royal was celebrated in
Norwich by the ringing of the bells of St. Peter Mancroft, and by
public dinners at the Royal Hotel.&nbsp; A ball took place in the
evening, at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The day was similarly
observed at Yarmouth, Lynn, and other towns in the county, and
addresses of congratulation were afterwards sent to the Queen by
the respective Corporations.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The long-pending case, Preston <i>v.</i> the Eastern
Counties and Norfolk Railway Companies, was before the Court of
Exchequer, and Mr. Baron Watson delivered judgment.&nbsp; The
first count of the declaration charged the defendants with
diverting and obstructing the waters of the rivers, and the
second with omitting to repair certain locks, whereby the water
escaped.&nbsp; Judgment was given against the Eastern Counties
Railway Company for 40s. on all issues, and for the Norfolk
Railway Company on their plea of not guilty, but against them on
all other issues.&nbsp; Finally the case was before the Rolls
Court on June 8th, and was entered as the Attorney-General
<i>v.</i> the Norfolk <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and Eastern Counties Railway
Companies.&nbsp; The object of the information was to have it
declared that the defendants were not by their Acts of Parliament
empowered to divert or obstruct any of the waters of the Rivers
Yare and Waveney, or other waters connected with them, except
Lake Lothing, for the purpose of supplying the entrance out
between Lake Lothing and the sea with water.&nbsp; The Court made
the injunction already granted perpetual against the Eastern
Counties Railway Company, and ordered the company to pay the
costs incurred in equity.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council accepted contracts
amounting to over &pound;9,000 for draining the northern portion
of the city.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A special meeting of the Norwich Court of Guardians,
attended by Lord Bury, M.P., and Mr. Schneider, M.P., was held to
consider the subject of a national poor-rate.&nbsp; It was stated
that Norwich paid &pound;20,000 a year more in poor relief than
it would if the principle of a national rate were adapted as the
law of the land.&nbsp; Both members of Parliament expressed
themselves in favour of national rating.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Mr. Thomas Barnes, R.G.S., was presented by the
Corporation of King&rsquo;s Lynn with an &ldquo;honorary
address,&rdquo; in lieu of the freedom of the borough,
&ldquo;disallowed by the Municipal Reform Act.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Baines, the son of a ship captain of the town, was a self-taught
artist, who achieved for himself a very honourable position by
his own enterprise and industry.&nbsp; He was serving as a
volunteer at the Cape when he was selected as artist to accompany
the North Australian Exploring Expedition, under Mr.
Gregory.&nbsp; At the time of the presentation he was about to
join Livingstone, on his expedition into the heart of
Africa.&nbsp; Mr. Baines had already received considerable
honours from the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was a
member, and from other learned bodies.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;A public meeting was held at the Guildhall, Norwich,
to consider a Bill then before Parliament introduced for the
purpose of amalgamating the Norwich Gas Company with the British
Gas Company.&nbsp; A resolution was adopted affirming that the
operation of the proposed Bill would be very prejudicial to the
interests of the ratepayers and inhabitants, by placing the
future management of the gas supply in the hands of a company
which had no local connection or sympathy with the interests of
Norwich, and over whom the rate-payers and inhabitants would have
no control.&nbsp; The meeting having heard the report of the
Special Committee appointed by the Corporation, cordially
approved the course adopted by the Committee, and pledged itself
to use every effort to oppose the passing of the Bill.&nbsp; A
petition was addressed to the House of Commons against the Bill,
and on the 16th the Town Council adopted the same petition.&nbsp;
The House of Commons Committee on Private Bills sat on April
20th, for the purpose of hearing objections to the measure.&nbsp;
The proceedings closed on the 23rd, when the Bill was ordered to
be reported to the House.</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Henry Stracey, of Rackheath Hall, has
obtained provisional protection for a cartridge which, by a very
simple contrivance, <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>gets rid of the necessity of biting off the end, a
proceeding which is always objectionable.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;Lord Stanley was re-elected member of Parliament for
the borough of King&rsquo;s Lynn, on his appointment as Secretary
to the Colonial Department.&nbsp; On June 5th his lordship was
again re-elected, on accepting the presidency of the Board of
Control, vacated by Lord Ellenborough.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at his residence, South Quay, Yarmouth, Sir Eaton
Stanley Travers.&nbsp; A son of Mr. John Travers, of Hethyfield
Grange, co. Cork, he was born in 1782, and entered the Navy
September 15th, 1798, as midshipman, on board the Juno.&nbsp; He
saw much active service, and was nine times mentioned in
despatches.&nbsp; He was nominated K.H. on February 4th, 1834,
and on March 5th in the same year had conferred upon him the
honour of knighthood.&nbsp; Sir Eaton Travers was a Deputy
Lieutenant of Norfolk.&nbsp; He married in April, 1815, Anne,
eldest daughter of William Steward, of Yarmouth, by whom he had
issue five sons and two daughters.</p>
<p>6.*&mdash;&ldquo;Within the last few days a stone has been
placed in the churchyard at East Dereham, in memory of Jean de
Narde, a French prisoner of war, who, in the year 1796 while
<i>en route</i> from Yarmouth to Norman Cross prison, was lodged
in the lower chamber of the bell tower of the church, and escaped
therefrom.&nbsp; He was pursued by the guard, and, after some
search, was espied in a tree on the Scarning Road, and when
summoned by a soldier to descend and surrender he did not
comply.&nbsp; His non-compliance forfeited his life, for he was
shot off it like a crow.&nbsp; The stone was erected by the vicar
and two other gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Miss Vandenhoff, tragic actress, from Drury Lane and
Haymarket Theatres, commenced an engagement at Norwich Theatre,
in her play, &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s Heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; She also
appeared in &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Sacrifice,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ingomar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22.&mdash;In the House of Lords, Lord Sondes presented a
petition from the Town Council and certain magistrates of
Yarmouth, praying for an inquiry into a recent appointment of
justices for that borough.&nbsp; It was stated that the
magistrates were constant in their attendance upon the Bench, and
were sufficiently numerous.&nbsp; The borough contained 31,000
inhabitants, there were 31 magistrates, and 31 policemen.&nbsp;
Upon the Bench every shade of political feeling was represented,
but all the newly-appointed magistrates were of one political
party.&nbsp; The Mayor of Yarmouth had interviewed the Lord
Chancellor, and his lordship had intimated that it was his
intention to persist in the appointment, and, moreover, he felt
it his duty to appoint new magistrates of one particular
party.&nbsp; The action of the Lord Chancellor had excited much
feeling in the borough.&nbsp; Lord Cranworth now informed the
House that he felt bound to put the magistracy in a position in
which justice should not be partially administered, and if an
inquiry were instituted it should have his entire
concurrence.&nbsp; No further action resulted.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>23.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town
Council, a resolution was adopted expressing surprise and
indignation that a covert attempt had been made to pervert the
Grammar School and the Commercial School proposed to be
established into exclusive institutions, which would not only
deprive a large proportion of the inhabitants of the advantage of
the schools, but would condemn them in public estimation, and
tend to the frustration and utter subversion of the proposed
scheme.&nbsp; The Charity Trustees were requested to resist this
proceeding, to ascertain at whose instance the suggestion was
made, and to consider whether recent complaints did not
imperatively demand that a searching inquiry should be instituted
into the conduct and management of the Grammar School.&nbsp; The
Master of the Rolls, on July 17th, gave his decision upon the
Grammar School case, which had long been before the Courts.&nbsp;
It was ordered that twenty-one governors be appointed; the sum of
&pound;1,000 per annum derived from land and house property was
to be appropriated to the maintenance of the Grammar School and
Commercial School; the benefits of the Grammar School were to be
open to all England; and all the expenses to which the
Corporation and those who represented Norwich had been put were
to be paid by the Charity Trustees.&nbsp; On December 4th the
<span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> made the following
remarkable statement in relation to the treatment of boys at the
Grammar School: &ldquo;We have recently been informed of a
circumstance connected with the Grammar School which we could
scarcely have credited but for the authority upon which we have
received it.&nbsp; It is that there exists in that school a form
of punishment which ought long since to have been unknown in a
civilised country, amounting very nearly to bodily torture.&nbsp;
We have been assured that for offences of a not very serious
character boys are placed for hours between shelves so
constructed that they cannot stand upright, but are obliged to
stoop until the head is brought nearly level with the
knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a meeting of the Governors of the School,
on December 8th, it was resolved, &ldquo;That in consequence of
the informant declining to come to the Governors and substantiate
the charge referred to in the <span
class="smcap">Chronicle</span> newspaper of last Saturday, we
proceed no further in the matter; but that we intimate to Dr.
Vincent that we strongly disapprove of the mode of punishment
alluded to in that newspaper, and if it has been practised, we
request it may be discontinued.&rdquo;&nbsp; The accusation was
not denied, either by Dr. Vincent or by anyone on his
behalf.&nbsp; On December 27th Dr. Vincent resigned his
appointment as headmaster.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Died at Hempnall, John Holmes, aged 104.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The deceased leaves behind him a son, Thomas, aged 87
years, and a grandson, aged 60 years, the latter himself being a
great-grandfather, thus presenting the remarkable fact of a man
living to witness the sixth generation, and to see his
great-grandson become a grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The first annual dinner of the Norfolk and Norwich
Anglers&rsquo; Society was held at the Bell Hotel, Norwich, under
the presidency of Mr. R. N. Bacon.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;Mr. R. Rising, of Costessey, rode his horse for a
wager over nine consecutive single hurdles set up in the centre
of a field.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>performed in excellent style, coming
back also over the same ground, and not refusing one.&nbsp; The
spectators were rather astonished to see Mr. Rising repeat the
feat with cap in hand.&nbsp; The judge of the bet, one of the
first riders in the Norfolk Hunt, asked permission to ride the
horse himself, saying he had ridden many good horses, but never
one that would take a single hurdle.&nbsp; Upon Mr. Rising
consenting, he rode the same round, thus making the animal in all
leap 54 single hurdles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Died, in his 82nd year, Mr. John Venning, of Surrey
House, Norwich.&nbsp; A native of Totnos, Devonshire, he spent
several years in Russia, as the representative of a firm of
merchants.&nbsp; He became a member of the church at which the
Rev. R. Knill officiated in St. Petersburg, and devoted his time
and means to improving the wretched condition of the neglected
and depraved populace of the Russian metropolis.&nbsp; He founded
a school on the Lancasterian system for poor Russian children, a
free school for the children of foreigners, a refuge for the
reception and care of the helpless and destitute, a lunatic
asylum in which the best modes of treatment were introduced, the
Litofsky prison, constructed to admit of the classification and
separation of prisoners; and he remodelled the great hospital for
the reception of invalids.&nbsp; Mr. Venning gained the esteem of
the Emperors Alexander and Nicholas, and the hearty co-operation
of the Empress Dowager, as well as of other members of the
Imperial family.&nbsp; Through his instrumentality all exiles
starting for Siberia were furnished with copies of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; When the destructive inundation of November,
1824, overwhelmed the city with the waters of the Neva, the Grand
Duke Michael sent General Politica with 20,000 roubles to Mr.
Venning to distribute among the suffering populace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Throughout his long life Mr. Venning was a conscientious
Dissenter&mdash;an Independent&mdash;but he saw without regret
his nearest and dearest relations staunch members of the Church
of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; He married a daughter of Mr. Meybohm, of
St. Petersburg, by whom he was survived.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;St. John&rsquo;s church, Yarmouth, erected at the
estimated cost of &pound;1,700, was consecrated by the Bishop of
Norwich.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died, in his 77th year, Mr. Thomas Osborn
Springfield, one of the magistrates of Norwich, and head of the
firm of Springfield, Son, and Nephew, of St. Mary&rsquo;s,
Norwich, and Coleman Street, London.&nbsp; Born in a
comparatively humble sphere, he rose from the position of a small
tradesman to a large silk merchant, &ldquo;and during his career
won and lost several fortunes, in consequence of the fluctuations
of the silk markets.&rdquo;&nbsp; His business career ended
prosperously.&nbsp; He took an active part in all local matters,
from the election of a parish beadle to that of a member of
Parliament, ranging himself on the side called Radical.&nbsp; As
he himself avowed, whenever he engaged in a contest he went in to
win, and many of his victories were, doubtless, most
costly.&nbsp; In 1827 he was elected one of the Sheriffs, and in
1829 Mayor of the city.&nbsp; After the passing of the Municipal
Reform Act, he was, in 1836, selected to be the first Chief
Magistrate under the new order of things.&nbsp; With a majority
of one only of elected councillors, the Liberals were able to add
sixteen aldermen to their number.&nbsp; This power they then
exercised to the fullest extent, selecting men of their own party
only, a one-sided system which was pursued without a break to the
day of Mr. Springfield&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In 1852 <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>he was
solicited by requisition to become a candidate for the
representation of the city, and if he had been inclined to accede
there is little doubt that he would have secured his
election.&nbsp; In private life Mr. Springfield exhibited many
good traits; he was never unamiable nor ungenerous, and there
were not a few persons in the city who could trace their first
advancement in life to his assistance.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The action in relation to the East Dereham Corn
Exchange came before the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; An
order was made upon the Corn Exchange Company to pay the costs of
the suit, except so far as they were incurred by the inquiries
raised as to the user of the site occupied by the Corn Exchange,
for the purpose of fairs and markets, and that they also pay the
costs of the proceedings by way of indictment on the several
counts upon which a verdict had been found for the Crown.&nbsp;
The case was then ordered to stand over until after the Trinity
term, for the consideration of the Attorney-General as to what
further decree or order, if any, he might think right to apply
for.&nbsp; The Vice-Chancellor declined to order the building to
be pulled down as asked for by the relators, because it was a
great public improvement.&nbsp; On June 26th the final decision
was announced, namely, that upon payment by the proprietors of
the new Corn Exchange of the costs awarded by the Court of
Chancery and of &pound;100 to the East Dereham Corn Market
Company, the suit would be withdrawn, and in case of any
indictment laid a <i>nolle prosequi</i> be entered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These proceedings are, therefore, terminated.&nbsp; The
hall is to remain, and the payment for admission will continue as
heretofore.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 16th, 1866.)</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Mountjoy the pedestrian, then in his 58th year,
started from Lynn to Wisbech for his task of walking sixty-seven
miles a day for four successive days.&nbsp; On August 16th he
began a walk from Norwich to Dereham and back twice every day,
but on the 17th was stopped on his way to Norwich, by order of
the magistrates, because of the obstruction caused by the number
of persons who assembled on the roads in the vicinity of the
city.&nbsp; Mountjoy was apprehended in Norwich on September
11th, for leaving his wife and family chargeable to the funds of
the St. Pancras Union; and on the same night attempted to commit
suicide in his cell at the Guildhall by strangling himself with a
pockethandkerchief.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Died at Colne House, Cromer, aged 46, Sir Edward
North Buxton, Bart., M.P.&nbsp; He was son of Sir Thomas Fowell
Buxton, first baronet, by the fifth daughter of Mr. John Gurney,
of Earlham Hall, where he was born in 1812, and married in 1836
the second daughter of Mr. Samuel Gurney, of Ham House,
Essex.&nbsp; He succeeded to the title on the death of his

of the Mayor and Sheriff, the officers of the 15th Hussars,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Hoffman, who had already visited Norwich as the
manager of an &ldquo;organophonic&rdquo; band, announced himself
as the representative of &ldquo;the Society for the Promotion of
Public Amusements&rdquo;&mdash;an entirely fictitious
organization.&nbsp; Business was suspended in Norwich, the
railway companies ran excursion trains, and the streets were
thronged by many thousands of persons anxious to witness the
&ldquo;grand Middle-age pageant.&rdquo;&nbsp; This consisted of a
procession of between thirty and forty persons on foot and one
horseman.&nbsp; It was everywhere received with groans and
hisses.&nbsp; Ten thousand persons were present on the Cricket
Ground to witness the &ldquo;Old English Sports&rdquo;; every
item in the programme resulted in failure, and a <i>bal
champ&ecirc;tre</i> was described as &ldquo;a disgraceful affair,

<p>7.*&mdash;&ldquo;The date of the present harvest will be
remembered as the year in which reaping machines were fully
established in Norfolk.&nbsp; It was only last year that they
were introduced, for although there had been one or two in the
county previously, they were not of the right sort, and it was
not until M&rsquo;Cormick&rsquo;s reaper, as now made by Burgess
and Key, that their number increased or their merits were
appreciated by Norfolk farmers.&nbsp; The fact that the chief
part of the Hussey machines, with their back delivery, have been
returned or laid aside, and that on most large farms there was
<i>one</i> of Burgess and Key&rsquo;s last year there are two
this harvest, will at once point out which machine is best
adapted to Norfolk agriculture.&rdquo;</p>

Holt.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died at Woodbridge, Mr. David Fisher, aged 70.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was a highly talented and respectable public character,
and had resided at Woodbridge since his retirement from the stage
twenty years previously.&nbsp; He belonged to a class much more
numerous half a century since than at the present day.&nbsp; He
was not only an actor, as nine-tenths of those who now strut
their hour upon the stage are, by <i>profession</i>, but by
intuition.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher was blessed with very rare histrionic
and musical attainments.&nbsp; When he appeared at Drury Lane, as
the contemporary and rival of Edmund Kean, it was felt to be the
nearest approximation then or since seen to the overtowering
abilities of that great dramatic luminary.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher, his
father and family, made greater efforts than any other family
ever did to establish and cultivate in the counties of Norfolk
and Suffolk a taste for the drama, at a time when this amusement
was more calculated to serve the highest office of the stage than
in the present degenerate days.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher built himself
theatres at Bungay, Beccles, Halesworth, Wells, North Walsham,
Dereham, Lowestoft, Eye, and other towns, entirely at his own
cost.&nbsp; He generally used to feel his way by sending a
company in advance for a few seasons, who located themselves in
such buildings as were available for their temporary <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>purposes, and
then, having whetted the appetites of the dwellers in rural
districts for one of the most intellectual of all amusements, he
summoned up courage to build a theatre, generally one of the best
structures in the town.&nbsp; For very many years these
speculations proved remunerative, even though the season did not
last more than two or three months, and at intervals generally of
two years.&nbsp; It is rarely that a good actor makes a good
manager, but Mr. Fisher was an honourable exception to this
rule&mdash;indeed, it was difficult to say what department this
distinguished gentleman could not fill, and fill well, too.&nbsp;
He was a first-rate musician, and for a considerable time was
leader at our choral concerts, and occupied a good position at
our first and early Festivals.&nbsp; So versatile was his genius
that he has been known to play in the overture, then to appear in
almost every act of the tragedy of &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; and
subsequently re-appear as Dr. O&rsquo;Toole in the farce of
&lsquo;The Irish Tutor.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was also an admirable
scene painter.&nbsp; During the latter years of his management he
was much assisted by his two brothers, Charles and George.&nbsp;
Finding that the palmy days of the drama were fast fading away,
Mr. Fisher retired from public life when about 50 years of age,
and before all the little reserve fund he had accumulated was too
much wasted to enjoy the evening of life in a quiet and
unostentatious privacy.&nbsp; He was very much esteemed where he
lived and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The Thorpe Grove estate, formerly the property of
Mr. George Harvey, deceased, was sold for &pound;11,390, about
&pound;2,000 in excess of the valuation sent in previous to the

December, 1809; Lieut.-Colonel, June 4th, 1814; Colonel, January
10th, 1837; Major-General, Nov. 9th, 1846; and Lieut.-General,
June 20th, 1854.&nbsp; He served twenty-five years in the 11th
Dragoons, and was in Flanders and Holland in 1794&ndash;95, and
in the latter year saw service in Germany.&nbsp; He took part in
the attack on the French lines, was present at their defeats on
the heights of Cateau and near Tournay, and was at the battles of
Roubaix, Launey, and other engagements.&nbsp; Under Sir Ralph
Abercromby, he commanded a detachment of his regiment at Leghorn,
Minorca, at the expedition to Cadiz in 1800, in Egypt in 1801,
and was at the capture of Grand Cairo and Alexandria.&nbsp; In
the Peninsula campaigns of 1811 and 1812 he was present at the
siege of Badajoz, the battle of Salamanca, and the affair of
cavalry near the Tormes on the following day, when three French
battalions were taken.&nbsp; He was at the cavalry affairs of
Callada Camino and Fenta de Poso.&nbsp; He served also in the
campaign of 1815, and was at the battles of Quatre Bras and
Waterloo; towards the close of the latter the command of the 11th
Dragoons devolved upon him.&nbsp; General Money married, in 1841,
Lady Annetta Laura Maria Waldegrave, daughter of the sixth Earl
of Waldegrave.&nbsp; She died in 1856, leaving two daughters.</p>

abstain, both directly and indirectly, from and to discountenance
treating and every form of corrupt or illegal practice or
expenditure, and also engaging not to practice canvassing; that
in case of infraction of the above-named, it be referred to the
Right Hon. William E. Gladstone, M.P., and the Right Hon. Spencer
Horatio Walpole, M.P., as referees, or to such third person as
they might name, to determine whether the understanding had been
honourably carried out or not, and the member or members returned
should be bound to abide by such decision and to resign his or
their seats if it were adjudged that his or their election was
secured or promoted by the violation of such understanding, and
that the other candidates and parties subscribing such
declaration should also abide by the decision of such referees or
umpire.&nbsp; The report was adopted, and a committee appointed
to give effect to it.&nbsp; On October 29th a meeting was held at
the Guildhall, convened by the following circular, issued by the
Mayor (Mr. Middleton) and the Deputy-Mayor (Mr. Field):
&ldquo;Having heard from various quarters that an unusual effort
will be made by each political party to secure the majority at
the approaching municipal elections, we take upon ourselves the
responsibility of asking our fellow-citizens to meet . . . with
the view of saving the city, if possible, from a repetition of <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>those
disgraceful proceedings which have recently taken place in
Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the meeting the Deputy-Mayor moved the
following resolution: &ldquo;That, in the opinion of this
meeting, the business of the Town Council and the Corporation of
Guardians ought henceforth to be conducted without reference to
political interests, but alone with the view of promoting the
best interests of the citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp; The discussion
showed that the principle of the resolution was not agreeable to
the meeting, whereupon Mr. Field withdrew it, and the proceedings
ended.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Miss Goddard, a tragic actress of some repute,
appeared at Norwich Theatre, in the character of Hamlet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hamlet is now played by a woman,&rdquo; wrote the critic,
&ldquo;infinitely better than it has been played by almost any of
the opposite sex who have ever attempted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s birthday was celebrated in Norwich
by the entertainment at dinner at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, of
nearly 700 of the poor of the city, at the joint expense of the

<p>&mdash;The Volunteer movement commenced in Norfolk on this
date.&nbsp; A public meeting, convened by the Mayor of Norwich,
by request of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, was held at the
Shirehall.&nbsp; It was decided that the inhabitants of the city
and neighbourhood be invited to enrol themselves as active and
honorary members of the Norwich Rifle Corps Club.&nbsp; All
members were to provide their own uniform, the expense of which
was not to exceed &pound;3 or &pound;4, and if the Government did
not provide arms, the Committee would assist in individual cases
to such an extent as the funds would permit.&nbsp; Honorary
members were to pay an annual subscription of one guinea.&nbsp;
The drill required from active members was not to exceed two
hours a day on three days a week, and they were assured that
&ldquo;on no occasion could they be called from Norwich except in
case of actual invasion or rebellion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many
Volunteers were enrolled at the conclusion of the meeting.&nbsp;
Similar meetings were held in all the towns of the county, and
the movement soon became general.&nbsp; At an adjourned meeting,
held at the Shirehall, Norwich, on July 2nd, and presided over by
Lieut.-Col. FitzRoy, &ldquo;to consider the best patterns for the
clothing and accoutrements of the Rifle Corps in the towns
throughout the county,&rdquo; it was resolved, &ldquo;That the
uniform for the city of Norwich and the boroughs in the county be
a gray cloth tunic coat with black mohair braid and buttons down
the centre, with a low, upright collar, and trousers of the same
colour and material, and with a shako of hair cloth of the same
colour as the uniform, that a plume be worn, and that the
appointments be a patent leather black waistbelt, with pouch
bags; the officers&rsquo; dress to be distinguished by some
embroidery above the cuff of the coat and by a pouch-belt, with
bronzed whistle and chain, and a slung waistbelt, with sword and
steel scabbard.&rdquo;&nbsp; A general meeting of the members of
the three companies formed in Norwich&mdash;the Mayor&rsquo;s
Company, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Company, and Mr. Hay Gurney&rsquo;s
Company&mdash;was held at the Guildhall, on July 5th, when the
officers were elected as follows: For the Mayor&rsquo;s Company,

the Sheriff&rsquo;s Company, Mr. Henry Morgan lieutenant, and Mr.
Charles Foster ensign.&nbsp; For Mr. Hay Gurney&rsquo;s Company,
Mr. Croker lieutenant, and Mr. Charles Henry Gurney ensign.&nbsp;
The captains were respectively Mr. Middleton (Mayor), Mr. H. S.
Patteson (Sheriff), and Mr. Hay Gurney.&nbsp; In the month of
September two additional companies were formed, one commanded by
Mr. J. H. Orde, with Mr. E. P. Youell as lieutenant and Mr. J.
Tomlinson as ensign; and the other by Mr. William Swatman (brevet
colonel), with Mr. F. J. Cresswell as lieutenant.&nbsp; The first
public parade of the corps took place on October 7th, when the
muster was 220, and &ldquo;Capt. Black, an honorary member of the
corps, kindly consented to put them through their evolutions on
the Cricket Field.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Simms Reeve, the honorary
secretary, announced on November 5th that long Enfield rifles had
been supplied by Government free of cost; and on December 5th, at
a general meeting of the corps, Major Brett was elected Major
Commandant.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>17.&mdash;A petition against the return of Lord Bury and Mr.
Schneider as members of Parliament for Norwich, was presented in
the House of Commons.&nbsp; Bribery and other corrupt and illegal
practices were alleged.&nbsp; The Special Committee appointed to
inquire into the petition sat on July 29th, and on July 30th
decided &ldquo;That the election of Lord Bury and Mr. Schneider
was a void election, and that both, by their agents, were guilty
of bribery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Samuel Bignold, on his return from
London, on the 30th, was welcomed by an immense crowd at Thorpe
Station, and, escorted by a torch-light procession headed by a
band of music, his carriage was dragged in triumph to his
residence in Surrey Street.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A writ was issued for the election of a member of
Parliament for Norwich, in consequence of a vacancy caused in the
representation of the city by the acceptance of the appointment
of Comptroller of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Household by Viscount
Bury.&nbsp; The nomination took place at the Guildhall, on the
28th, when the candidates were Viscount Bury, Sir Samuel Bignold,
and Col. Henry George Baldero.&nbsp; The show of hands was in
favour of Lord Bury, and a poll was demanded on behalf of Sir
Samuel Bignold and Col. Baldero.&nbsp; The poll was opened on the
29th, and declared on the 30th, as follows: Bury, 1,922; Bignold,
1,561; Baldero, 39.&nbsp; Lord Bury was declared elected.&nbsp;

Christian Religion,&rdquo; and editor of Morell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Thesaurus,&rdquo; and wrote a very learned and judicious
book on &ldquo;Divinity.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held one of the prebends
of Lincoln Cathedral and the living of Brickdon.&nbsp; In 1831 he
was consecrated Bishop of Chichester, and was translated to
Durham in 1836.&nbsp; Under Act of Parliament he resigned the
latter see in September, 1856, and was allowed an annuity of
&pound;4,500.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Died at Roydon Rectory, the Rev. Temple Frere, canon

Mr. John Frere, for some years member of Parliament for Norwich,
and took his B.A. degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1802,
as eighth junior optime, migrating afterwards to Downing
College.&nbsp; Ordained deacon in 1804 and priest in 1805, he was
presented, in 1820, to the family living of Roydon (valued at
&pound;400), which he held until his death.&nbsp; He owned the
greater part of Diss, and was an active magistrate in that
division of the county.&nbsp; Having served some time as chaplain
of the House of Commons, he was gazetted to a canonry in
Westminster Abbey in 1838.&nbsp; Canon Frere was remarkable for
his businesslike habits, and is said to have considerably
improved in value the Abbey estates.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The new &ldquo;marine promenade&rdquo; at
Wells-next-the-Sea, for which the town was indebted to the Earl

his mission for procuring funds to erect a &ldquo;monstre
tabernacle in London to accommodate the immense congregations
drawn together by his peculiar pulpit oratory.&rdquo;&nbsp; About
2,500 persons assembled at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall to hear his
sermon.&nbsp; In the evening Mr. Spurgeon preached in the open
air, in Chapel Field, to a congregation of more than
10,000.&nbsp; &ldquo;The collection at the afternoon service
amounted to &pound;28, which Mr. Spurgeon took occasion to say,
in introducing another collection in the evening, was the
shabbiest collection he had ever had.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the evening
&pound;23 was contributed.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The Donegal Militia, 300 strong, arrived at
Yarmouth, in the ss. Himalaya.&nbsp; Lieut.-Col. Lord Claud

<p>28.&mdash;A remarkable case of protracted abstinence from food
was discovered at St. Faith&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A man, who gave the
name of William Watling, of Felmingham, aged 60, was found in a
prostrate and apparently dying condition in a plantation.&nbsp;
His statement was to the effect that five weeks previously, when
tramping the country, he was overcome with heat and crawled into
the plantation.&nbsp; From that spot, he declared, he had not
moved for five weeks, and although persons passed very near the
wood, he failed, in consequence of physical exhaustion, to
attract their attention.&nbsp; He had neither food nor drink
during the whole time, and ate nothing but the grass and leaves
around him, and a few blackberries.&nbsp; &ldquo;His bones almost
protruded through his skin, and his flesh was nearly all dried
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The medical opinion was that he would not
recover, but there is no further record of the case.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;The ceremony of laying the first stone of the new

the Rev. Josiah Pratt, he gave up a lucrative business for the
laborious post of co-secretary in the Church Missionary House,

<p>8.&mdash;Died, in the 100th year of her age, Mary Tallowin, of
Bowthorpe.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>11.&mdash;Charles Dickens gave a reading, at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, of the &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; and the
trial scene from &ldquo;The Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; and on the
12th read the story of Little Dombey and of Mrs. Gamp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The reception of Mr. Dickens, on his first appearing in
front of a very artistically arranged screen, was cordial and
enthusiastic.&nbsp; His voice was far from powerful, but he had
remarkable expression and the power of exhibiting this in face as
well as in voice.&nbsp; As a pecuniary speculation, it must have
been highly profitable to Mr. Dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The town of Attleborough was, for the first time,
lighted with gas, an event which was celebrated by a public
dinner at the New Inn.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;At the Norwich Quarter Sessions, John Plummer (25),
shoemaker, was indicted for stealing a model of a gold nugget,
the property of the trustees of the Norfolk and Norwich
Museum.&nbsp; Mr. Reeve, the curator of the Museum, stated that
the model was worth only a few shillings, but it was an
attractive object, and generally supposed by visitors, and no
doubt by the prisoner, to be a piece of genuine gold.&nbsp; The
prisoner was sentenced to seven years&rsquo; penal servitude.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;At the Norfolk Quarter Sessions, the Police
Committee called attention to an Act of Parliament passed in the
previous month of August, empowering the substitution of
policemen for javelin men at the Assizes, and recommending that
the Chief Constable be authorised, on the application of the High
Sheriff, to employ a sufficient number of constables for that
purpose, the High Sheriff engaging to pay such sum as would, in
the estimation of the Chief Constable, be sufficient to meet the
additional expense of such employment.&nbsp; The matter was
adjourned for further consideration.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January
5th, 1860.)</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. R. M. Phipson was elected County Surveyor.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A singular question came before the Norwich Town
Council, in relation to the right of the Corporation to the
property of convicts.&nbsp; The Police Committee reported they
had been informed by the Chief Constable that on the apprehension
of one George Valentine, on a charge of felony, a large sum of
money was found in his possession.&nbsp; Valentine having been
tried and convicted at the Quarter Sessions, the Town Clerk had
stated that the city was entitled to the convict&rsquo;s
money.&nbsp; The Chief Constable wished to know how he should
dispose of the money.&nbsp; The Committee were advised that,
after the conviction, the city had become entitled to the money
under a Royal charter granted during the reign of Henry IV.&nbsp;
The Council ordered that the money remain in the hands of the
City Treasurer, pending further inquiry.&nbsp; The question was
again considered by the Council on May 12th, 1863, when the Town
Clerk reported that after Valentine&rsquo;s conviction it was
found that, in addition to the sum in question (&pound;90), he
had &pound;60 deposited in a savings bank in London.&nbsp; The
Town Clerk had given notice to the bank directors that the
Corporation claimed the money, but since the liberation of the
prisoner he had been pressed to withdraw the notices, and had
refused to do so without the sanction of the Corporation.&nbsp;
The difficulty under which the Corporation laboured was that the
money was out of their jurisdiction, and they had no control over
it beyond the notice that had been given.&nbsp; If further steps
were taken the question would arise whether it was a forfeiture
to the Corporation or to the Crown, but as this would involve an
inquisition, the cost of which would probably exhaust the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>money
enquired about, it was for the Council to say whether, the man,
having served his term of three years&rsquo; penal servitude, and
having petitioned for some relief from the fund to place him in a
position to gain an honest livelihood, they would authorise the
withdrawal of the notice.&nbsp; It was agreed that the notice be
withdrawn.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;A severe storm occurred off the Norfolk coast.&nbsp;
At Winterton two vessels were wrecked and thirteen lives
lost.&nbsp; At Yarmouth there were several wrecks, and for miles
the shore was strewn with remains of cargoes and portions of
vessels.&nbsp; The sloop James and Jessie drifted on to the
Britannia Pier, and severed the structure into two parts.</p>

Rooms, Norwich, their entertainment entitled, &ldquo;Seaside
Studies.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, Mr. J. H.
Tillett was elected Mayor, and Mr. Joseph Underwood appointed
Sheriff.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. Tillett, on taking his seat as Mayor of Norwich,
informed the Town Council that an attempt had been made to bribe
one of the Councillors.&nbsp; Mr. Joel Fox, the member in
question, produced the halves of three &pound;100 bank notes,
which, he alleged, the Conservatives had handed to him to induce
him to vote for eight Conservative Aldermen.&nbsp; After the vote
had been recorded the payment was to be completed.&nbsp; Amid
much excitement, a Special Committee was appointed to investigate
the case.&nbsp; On November 12th, before the Committee had
presented their report, criminal proceedings were instituted
against Mr. Albert John Collins, solicitor, a member of the firm
of Beckwith and Collins, who was charged at the Police Court with
conspiring with Henry Croxford, stationer and others, to bribe
Joel Fox, Town Councillor, by promising and offering him a sum of
money to vote for certain Aldermen.&nbsp; Croxford, the other
defendant, had absconded.&nbsp; Fox alleged that he went to
Croxford&rsquo;s house, where he was shown the halves of three
&pound;100 notes and four &pound;50 notes, which were offered to
him by Croxford, on behalf of Collins, on condition that he voted
for the Conservative Aldermen.&nbsp; After formal evidence, the
case was adjourned.&nbsp; On the 16th the Committee of the
Council asked for full power and authority to proceed with the
investigation, and to take such steps as might be necessary for
the prosecution of the offenders.&nbsp; The Council granted the
application.&nbsp; The magisterial proceedings were resumed on
the 17th, when Mr. Power, Q.C. (instructed by the Town Clerk, Mr.
Mendham), appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Serjeant
Ballantine for the defendant Collins.&nbsp; After further
evidence had been taken, the case was again adjourned.&nbsp;
Meanwhile informations had been laid against William Wilde,
William Wilde, the younger, William George Wilde, James Stowers,
and Sir William Foster, members of the Liberal party, for
conspiring to bribe at the last General Election for the
city.&nbsp; By way of reprisal, the Liberals obtained summonses,
through William Randell Lacey, against Sir Samuel Bignold, the
Rev. F. S. Bignold, J. H. Bignold, James Hardy, Capt. Ives, and
G. Priest, for unlawfully conspiring by bribery and other illegal
means to return Sir Samuel Bignold and Mr. Charles Lushington at
the last election of members of Parliament.&nbsp; On Nov. <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>19th the
magistrates decided to hear all the cases on December 8th.&nbsp;
A special meeting of the Town Council was held on December 6th,
to consider the following motion by Mr. Simms Reeve: &ldquo;That
it is the opinion of this Council that the peace and welfare of
the city will be best promoted by the cessation of political
strife, and, with the view to the attainment of that object, the
resolution of the Council of the 16th November last, with
reference to the charge of bribery made by Mr. Councillor Fox, be
cancelled, and that all further legal proceedings against Henry
Croxford and Albert John Collins and others for conspiracy be
stayed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was seconded by Mr. Field.&nbsp;
Mr. C. M. Gibson moved, as an amendment, &ldquo;That the due
administration of justice is essential to the peace and welfare
of the city, and it is therefore the opinion of the Council that
the resolution of the 16th November . . . should be again
confirmed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was carried by 28 votes
against 19.&nbsp; On December 8th, when the magisterial
proceedings were resumed, the Town Clerk said he had no
instructions from the Town Council to proceed with the
prosecution.&nbsp; After he had formally withdrawn, Mr. R. N.
Bacon, Mr. J. J. Colman, Mr. J. Youngs, Mr. J. Newbegin, Mr. C.
N. Bolingbroke, the Rev. G. Gould, the Rev. J. Crompton, Mr. E.
C. Holland, and Mr. John Pymar appeared as prosecutors, and Mr.
Power claimed to be heard as their counsel.&nbsp; The Bench
decided that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case against
Collins, who was discharged on giving sureties to answer any
charge that might be made against him at the Assizes.&nbsp;
Serjeant Ballantine thereupon said that he would offer no
evidence in the charges against the Messrs. Wilde, and Mr. S. H.
Asker, who appeared for the complainant Lacey, withdrew the
summons issued on his information.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Mr. Louth, landlord of the Rampant Horse Hotel,
Norwich, received fatal injuries by the overturning of his

<p>30.&mdash;The foundation-stone of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Wherrymen&rsquo;s chapel, at Yarmouth, was laid by the Mayor (Mr.

the new Fishmarket, Norwich, by the falling in of three of the
arches beneath the &ldquo;promenade.&rdquo;&nbsp; A workman,
named William Powley, of Necton, was killed, and another workman
sustained a broken leg.&nbsp; At the adjourned inquest, on
December 15th, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death,
with the rider: &ldquo;They consider, from the evidence <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>of eminent
architects of London and builders of Norwich, that the buildings
are in an unsafe condition, and require the immediate attention
of the Corporation, in order to insure the perfect safety of the
public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5.&mdash;At the County Sessions, at Norwich, the Committee
appointed at the previous Sessions recommended that the Chief
Constable, on the application of the High Sheriff, be allowed to
supply police-constables for keeping order in the Assize Courts,
in place of the javelin men previously employed, the High Sheriff
engaging to pay the additional expense.&nbsp; The Chairman (Sir
Willoughby Jones) remarked that theoretically the javelin men
kept the Courts, but practically they kept the neighbouring
public-houses.&nbsp; The recommendation was agreed to.&nbsp; On
March 27th, Mr. Justice Williams was received at Victoria Station
by the High Sheriff (Mr. Henry Birkbeck) and a posse of
policemen, &ldquo;in the place of the time-honoured body which
had long <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>constituted a conspicuous part of the pomp and
circumstance of our Assizes, having at length succumbed to the
utilitarian tyranny of the age.&nbsp; His arrival at the
Shirehall and Guildhall was signalised, however, by the customary
fanfaronade on a couple of inharmonious trumpets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>17.&mdash;Mr. E. E. Benest, City Surveyor, tendered his
resignation to the Norwich Town Council, after eight years&rsquo;
service.&nbsp; He was succeeded, on March 14th, by Mr. Thomas D.
Barry.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Lord Sondes was presented by his Norfolk tenantry
with a piece of plate, of the value of 140 gs., as a birthday

<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>7.&mdash;A fire occurred on the premises of Mr. W. C.
Aberdein, pastry cook, Dove Street, Norwich.&nbsp; The outbreak
itself was not of a serious character, but in a room upon the
adjoining premises of Mr. Cubitt, ironmonger, was stored upwards
of 400 lbs. of gunpowder, which was safely removed in wet
blankets.&nbsp; The circumstance caused much sensation, and the
practicability of establishing a public powder magazine was
discussed by the magistrates.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died at King&rsquo;s Lynn, Mr. J. F. Reddie, many
years organist at St. Margaret&rsquo;s church, in that town.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A petition against the return of Sir Edmund Lacon
and Sir H. Stracey, as members of Parliament for Great Yarmouth,
in April, 1859, commenced before a Special Committee of the House
of Commons.&nbsp; The petitioners, Mr. Joseph Bayly, surgeon, and
Mr. Robert Pilgrim, linen draper, alleged bribery, undue
influence, treating, and intimidation.&nbsp; On March 1st the
Committee declared the members to have been duly elected, and
were of opinion that one of the witnesses, Henry Fayerman, had
been guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury.&nbsp; The members were
received with great enthusiasm on their return to Yarmouth, and
were entertained at a public dinner, given at the Theatre, on
April 12th.&nbsp; At the Westminster Police Court, on June 11th,
Fayerman was committed for trial on the charge of perjury, but at
the Old Bailey, on July 12th, the jury gave a verdict of
acquittal.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;A terrible gale raged throughout the country.&nbsp;
At Norwich, between ten o&rsquo;clock and noon, the thermometer
rose from 36 degrees to 47 degrees; at two o&rsquo;clock it
registered 45 degrees.&nbsp; The wind blew from the west, veering
occasionally to the north and to <span
class="smcap">w.n.w.</span>, but during the height of the gale it
blew west by north.&nbsp; Great damage was done to buildings,
trees were uprooted, and &ldquo;locomotion was extremely
difficult and laborious, and, indeed, quite out of the question
to those of the fair sex whose fashionable expanded dresses,
assuming the properties of parachutes, compelled them to
undertake a species of aerial voyage for a distance of a few
yards, or exposed them to the still more unpleasant predicament
of having their parachute <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>garments inverted.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
were many disasters along the coast, and several lives were
lost.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;A Special Committee of the House of Commons sat to
decide various questions arising out of the elections at Norwich
in 1859.&nbsp; The first point to be decided was whether Lord
Bury&rsquo;s claim, by virtue of the election in July, was not
nullified by the bribery which was proved to have been made by
his agents when he was returned with Mr. Schneider in April; and
secondly, whether, in the event of such disqualification, Sir
Samuel Bignold or Colonel Boldero had a valid claim.&nbsp; There
were three petitions: (1) against the return of Lord Bury and the
qualification of Sir Samuel Bignold, on the ground that both had
been guilty of bribery at the April election, and the seat was,
therefore, claimed for Colonel Boldero (signed by Josiah
Fletcher, S. Jarrold, and J. J. Kempster); (2) alleging the
disqualification of Lord Bury, and claiming the seat for Sir
Samuel Bignold (signed by J. G. Johnson and R. Kerrison); and (3)
alleging the disqualification of both Lord Bury and Sir Samuel
Bignold, and claiming the seat for Colonel Boldero (signed by P.
Back and G. C. Stevens).&nbsp; No appearance was put in in
support of the first petition.&nbsp; The Committee declared that
Lord Bury was not merely disqualified from sitting in the House
of Commons during the then Parliament, but the last election was
void, in consequence of his lordship having been found, since
that return, guilty of bribery by his agents.&nbsp; A writ was
then issued for another election, and on March 28th the following
candidates were nominated: Mr. W. Forlonge (C), Aynhoe Park,
Northamptonshire; Mr. W. D. Lewis, Q.C. (C); Sir William Russell
(L), and Mr. Edward Warner (L).&nbsp; The polling took place on
the 29th, and the result was officially declared on the 30th, as
follows: Warner, 2,083; Russell, 2,045; Forlonge, 1,636; Lewis,
1,631.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died at his residence, Hillington Hall, aged 73, Sir
William John Henry Browne ffolkes, Bart.&nbsp; He represented the
county, and afterwards the Western Division, as a supporter of
Liberal principles from 1830 through the Reform era, but lost the
seat on the redaction of the Conservative party in 1837, when Mr.
Bagge and Mr. Chute were returned.&nbsp; As a magistrate, country
gentleman, and landlord, Sir William was highly esteemed.&nbsp;
He was Chairman of Quarter Sessions at Swaffham, and chairman of
the Norfolk Estuary Company.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his
grandson, William Howell, then in his twelfth year, and eldest
son of Martin Brown ffolkes, who was killed by lightning in July,
1849.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The Rev. J. W. L. Heaviside was installed Canon of
Norwich Cathedral, in succession to Canon Wodehouse,
resigned.&nbsp; Mr. Heaviside was a professor at Haileybury
College, an examiner in mathematics for the University of London
and for the Council of Military Education, and a brother of Mr.
Heaviside, formerly master of the Norwich School of Art.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn and a special jury, was tried a libel action, in which
Mr. Samuel B. Cory, solicitor, Yarmouth, was the plaintiff, and
Mr. T. W. Bond, <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>publisher of the &ldquo;Norfolk News,&rdquo; Norwich,
the defendant.&nbsp; The libel was contained in a letter written
to the newspaper by a Mr. Fabb, who alleged, among other things,
that Mr. Cory had laid informations in certain game cases, with
the object of putting the fees into his own pocket.&nbsp; Mr.
Fabb, it was understood, had indemnified the &ldquo;Norfolk
News.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff,
with one farthing damages, as to that part of the libel above
quoted, and for the defendant as to other portions of the libel,
on the ground that they had been justified as true.&nbsp; The
effect of the verdict was that plaintiff had to pay his own costs
and half the costs of the defendant.&nbsp; In a second action,
Mr. Fabb sued Mr. Cory for malicious prosecution, and obtained a
verdict for &pound;30 damages.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died, in her 63rd year, at Cheltenham, while on a
visit to her son-in-law, the Rev. J. F. Fenn, Lady Bignold, wife
of Sir Samuel Bignold.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;An important will case, Wright <i>v.</i> Wilkin,
commenced at the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn and a special jury.&nbsp; It was brought in the form of
an action for ejectment to recover possession of certain
tenements and lands held by the defendant, Thomas Martin Wilkin,
solicitor, of Lynn, under the will of an old lady named Mary
Mann.&nbsp; The plaintiff, who was heir-at-law, alleged that the
will was obtained from an infirm and weak-minded person by
fraudulent practices and contrivances.&nbsp; The will had already
been disputed, and in that trial a verdict was given in favour of
Mr. Wilkin; this action was brought because there had come to the
knowledge of the plaintiff facts and circumstances which had been
entirely withheld from the former jury.&nbsp; The trial lasted
until the afternoon of the 3rd, when the jury found for the
defendant, subject to argument upon certain points
reserved.&nbsp; These were stated in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench on April 9th, and were to the effect that the devise to the
defendant was defeated by his neglect to comply with a condition
of the will, namely, that the devise was conditional on the
devisee paying off certain legacies within twelvemonths in case
the personal estate should be insufficient for that
purpose.&nbsp; It transpired that the personal estate was
insufficient, but the defendant did not pay one of the legacies
within the time stipulated.&nbsp; It was also contended for the
plaintiff that the devise to the defendant was void, inasmuch as
it was a contrivance to defeat the Statute of Mortmain, several
of the legacies being for charitable purposes, and that the
defendant had misled the testatrix by not telling her that, under
43rd George III., she could leave as much as five acres of land
for the repair of the church.&nbsp; Lord Chief Justice Cockburn
granted a rule <i>nisi</i>.&nbsp; In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench, on November 27th, the Lord Chief Justice said the rule
must be discharged, as the words in the will were not intended to
impose a condition, the non-observance of which would involve
forfeiture.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Crompton and Mr. Justice Blackburn
concurred.&nbsp; The rule was discharged.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>24.&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s birthday was celebrated at Norwich
by a parade <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>on Mousehold of the Royal Horse Artillery, the West
Norfolk Militia, and the Rifle Volunteers.&nbsp; The Mayor
afterwards entertained the officers at luncheon at the Guildhall,
and in the evening the Volunteers dined at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, under the presidency of Major Brett.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;A violent gale from the north-west did extensive
damage in Norwich and throughout the county.&nbsp; Terrible
disasters were reported on the coast.&nbsp; Twenty vessels
belonging to Yarmouth and Lowestoft were lost, 200 men and boys
perished, and 240 women and children were left in a state of
destitution.&nbsp; On the 29th an inquiry was held at Yarmouth
into certain allegations as to the conduct of the beachmen and
crew of the lifeboat.&nbsp; It was stated that, in consequence of
differences which had arisen, much valuable time was lost in
launching the lifeboat, and a resolution expressing regret at the
delay was adopted.&nbsp; A public fund was raised for the
destitute families of the local fishermen.&nbsp; During the gale,
the north-east pinnacle of St. Peter&rsquo;s church, Yarmouth,
was dislodged, the windows of Cromer church were blown in, and at
Blickling 247 oaks were uprooted in the Great Wood, 216 in
Hercules Wood, and 190 in other portions of the park.&nbsp; It
was estimated that 1,500 trees were levelled on the estate.</p>
<p>&mdash;The American horse tamer, Rarey, gave an exhibition of
his system of training, in the riding school at the Cavalry
Barracks, Norwich.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;The Royal Horse Artillery marched from the Cavalry
Barracks, Norwich, <i>en route</i> to Woolwich, and were escorted
to the city boundary by the Rifle Volunteers.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;An extraordinary case, arising out of the sudden
disappearance of a lad named Vansittart, came before the Norwich
magistrates.&nbsp; The lad was a son of Mr. Vansittart, member of
Parliament for Windsor, and had been placed at school under the
care of the Rev. F. H. S. Hodgson, rector of Rackheath.&nbsp; At
Brighton, some time previously, he had developed Roman Catholic
tendencies, and his friends were anxious to remove him from the
sphere of such influences.&nbsp; Mr. Hodgson, while engaged in
parochial duties, missed the youth, and gave information to the
police at Norwich, who found him at the house of a Roman Catholic
jeweller, named Beha.&nbsp; The lad made a very singular
statement, to the effect that an Italian priest, attired in a
long blue cloak, had persuaded him to leave school and join the
Roman Catholics in London; that he had gone to Norwich and met
Canon Dalton, the priest at St. John Maddermarket Roman Catholic
chapel, to whom he had shown a watch belonging to a
school-fellow; that Canon Dalton had advanced him six shillings,
and recommended him to take the watch to Beha, for the purpose of
raising sufficient money to pay the balance of his railway fare
to London; and that he was preparing to start for town when he
was detained by the police.&nbsp; Canon Dalton declared that he
had not seen the lad prior to his coming to St. John
Maddermarket.&nbsp; The matter was adjourned for further inquiry,
and on the 11th Canon Dalton, Jacob Beha, Matthew Beha, and
Thomas Foulsham were required to attend before the magistrates,
when the proceedings were deferred until the 18th, the persons <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>named
protesting against the course adopted by the Bench, and urging
that no charge had at present been preferred against them.&nbsp;
Another adjournment took place until the 25th, when Mr. Serjeant
Ballantine appeared for the prosecution, and preferred a charge
of conspiracy against Canon Dalton and the Behas.&nbsp; The boy
Vansittart gave evidence, and, in cross-examination by Mr.
Woollett, counsel for the defence, admitted that he had told
&ldquo;a tissue of lies,&rdquo; and that the main points of his
story were entirely invented by himself.&nbsp; The magistrates
dismissed the case, but expressed the opinion that the conduct of
Canon Dalton was exceedingly reprehensible in not advising the
lad to return to his father.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died at his residence, at Thorpe, General Sir Robert
J. Harvey, C.B., K.T.S., Knight Commander of the Order of St.
Bento d&rsquo;Avis, F.R.S., F.A.S.&nbsp; Sir Robert, who was in
his 75th year, saw much active service during his military
career.&nbsp; He was present at the battles of the Douro and
Busaco, the battle of Salamanca, the siege of Burgos, and at
Vittoria, the Pyrenees (where he was wounded in the thigh by a
musket shot), Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse.&nbsp; The
long-protracted war having been brought to a close in 1815 by the
crowning victory at Waterloo, on the anniversary of which he
died, he returned to Norwich and became an acting partner in the
bank of Harveys and Hudson, and was head of the firm at the time
of his death.&nbsp; He was a magistrate and a Deputy Lieutenant
of Norfolk, president of the Norwich Union Life Office and the
Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, chairman of the General
Reversionary Interest Society in London, and founder of several
other important institutions of a kindred character.&nbsp; In
politics he was a Conservative, but took no prominent part in
local affairs.&nbsp; Sir Robert married a daughter of Mr. Robert
Harvey, of Walton, Suffolk, a distant relative, and was succeeded
by his eldest son, Mr. R. J. H. Harvey.&nbsp; The will of the
deceased was proved on February 21st, 1861, when the personalty
was sworn under &pound;350,000.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. R. J. H. Harvey
has purchased all his brother&rsquo;s (Mr. E. K. Harvey&rsquo;s)
interest under the will, so that he is now in possession of the
whole of the real and personal property of his late father,
subject to Lady Harvey&rsquo;s life interest in the Mousehold
estates and to the annuities named in the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, it
was agreed, &ldquo;That the Lords of the Treasury having
sanctioned the sale to the New Street Company of the property
required by them belonging to the Corporation for the sum of
&pound;3,260, and having required to be informed of the purpose
to which the Corporation propose to apply such purchase-money,
this Council agrees, with the sanction of the Lords of the
Treasury, to apply &pound;2,000 towards the making of the new
street, which, on its completion, will be vested in the
Corporation, and, the remaining &pound;1,260 towards the widening
of the present approach to the Cattle Market by Rose
Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The Channel Fleet, under the command of Admiral Sir
C. Fremantle, K.C.B., arrived in Yarmouth Roads.&nbsp; Since the
year 1814 no two ships of the line had been moored at the same
time off Yarmouth.&nbsp; The fleet consisted of nine ships of the
line, two frigates, a corvette, and a tender.&nbsp; The Mayor and
Corporation of the borough waited upon the Admiral and invited
the officers to a ball, but orders came for the fleet to sail
early on the morning of July 2nd.</p>

<p>23.&mdash;The Donegal Militia left Yarmouth.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Chief Baron Pollock
and a special jury, an action, Gillings <i>v.</i> Manders, was
tried.&nbsp; The plaintiff was a carpenter at Yarmouth, and the
defendant the proprietor of a travelling menagerie.&nbsp; One of
the attractions of the show was the performance of a Zulu named
Maccomo, who was styled a &ldquo;Lion King,&rdquo; and fired off
pistols and carbines in a cage containing half a dozen lions and
lionesses.&nbsp; In a performance given at Yarmouth, Maccomo,
instead of firing his pistol to the top of the cage, discharged
it among the spectators, and the wad entering the
plaintiff&rsquo;s eyes destroyed it.&nbsp; Muccomo said it was
the result of an accident.&nbsp; One of his lions attacked him in
a fit of temper, and the trigger, catching in the beast&rsquo;s
mane, was prematurely discharged.&nbsp; The jury found for the
plaintiff, damages &pound;150.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;In the Norwich Episcopal Consistory Court, Mr.
Chancellor Evans gave judgment in a protracted case, Archdeacon
Bouverie <i>v.</i> the Rev. W. L. Barnes.&nbsp; The suit was
instituted by the Archdeacon of Norfolk, against the rector of
Knapton, for procurations for the years
1856&ndash;57&ndash;58&ndash;59.&nbsp; The plaintiff alleged, in
his libels, that he was entitled to receive from the rector the
sum of 7s. 7&frac12;d., due at Michaelmas every year, by reason
of his visiting, of his archidiaconal dignity, or by
custom.&nbsp; Mr. Barnes required the Archdeacon to prove such
parts of his case as were not admitted, and, further, he said
that, supposing the case as stated in the libels were proved, the
Archdeacon was not entitled to be paid his procurations for the
years 1857&ndash;58&ndash;59, because he did not in those years
hold a parochial visitation at Knapton.&nbsp; The Court decreed
in favour of the Archdeacon, with costs, and Mr. Barnes gave
notice that he should appeal against the judgment.&nbsp; No
further proceedings, however, were taken.</p>

for the evening of the 21st.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only three individuals
appeared in fancy dress&mdash;costumes which, from their quality,
would have far more fitted a masquerade at the Baronial Hall than
an elegant assembly like that of Friday evening.&nbsp; The
wearers of them evidently felt ill at ease, and, after enduring
the rather marked observation that they attracted for some time,
were glad to call a fly and take their departure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The total receipts of the Festival amounted to &pound;5,095 16s.,

age he was indicted for the murder of his uncle near
Thetford.&nbsp; &ldquo;For many years he was considered so

26th, 1861, before Chief Baron Pollock, Mr. Marrison brought an
action against the London Union Fire Office, for the recovery of
&pound;300 under a policy of insurance on his stock and

proved that the plaintiff had kept more gunpowder on his premises
than was allowed by the terms of his contract, whereupon the
judge ordered a non-suit.</p>

His remains were interred at Rainham, on December 11th.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;The suit, Gurney <i>v.</i> Gurney and Taylor, came
before the Divorce Court, Westminster.&nbsp; The husband sought
dissolution of marriage, on the ground of misconduct by the
wife.&nbsp; A petition had been presented for the settlement of
property then vested in the wife in favour of the children, the
issue of the marriage, and the Solicitor-General applied for a
rule <i>nisi</i> calling on the respondent, Mrs. Gurney, to show
cause why a plea or a pleading in the nature of or intended to be
a plea should not be taken off the file, and why the petition for
settlement should not be treated as unanswered or
unopposed.&nbsp; Sir <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>C. Cresswell granted a rule
<i>nisi</i>.&nbsp; Evidence was given in the case on January
22nd, 1861, and the decree was made absolute on May 22nd.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;In the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court was heard the
action, Berney <i>v.</i> the Norfolk and Eastern Counties Railway
Company.&nbsp; By an agreement dated June 6th, 1843, the
plaintiff sold certain land to the Norwich and Yarmouth Railway
Company, and it was provided that such company should establish
and for ever maintain a station in connection with their railway
at Reedham, on part of the land sold to them by plaintiff.&nbsp;
Nothing was said in the agreement in reference to stopping trains
at the station.&nbsp; In 1844 the Norwich and Yarmouth railway
was completed, and a station was constructed in accordance with
the agreement, and called the Barney Arms Station, at which
certain trains stopped.&nbsp; In 1845 the Norwich and Yarmouth
Company was incorporated with the Norfolk Railway Company, and
trains continued to stop at the station until 1850, when the
Norfolk Company discontinued the practice.&nbsp; The plaintiff
thereupon instituted this suit, praying for a specific
performance of the agreement of June, 1843, and an injunction to
restrain the Norfolk Company from permitting the trains on their
railway to pass the Berney Arms Station without stopping thereat,
which was, in effect, to compel the company to stop the trains at
that station.&nbsp; The motion for the injunction did not come
on, in consequence of an arrangement whereby the Norfolk Company
agreed to stop at Berney Arms Station one train from Norwich and
one from Yarmouth on every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.&nbsp;
The Norfolk Railway was now worked by the Eastern Counties
Railway on an agreement dated in 1854, which had received the
sanction of the Legislature.&nbsp; The Eastern Counties Company
were then made parties to the suit.&nbsp; Although the trains
then stopped in a manner satisfactory to the plaintiff, there was
no security that they would continue to do so.&nbsp; The
Vice-Chancellor said there must be a specific performance of the
agreement of June, 1843, and an order that one train from Norwich
and one from Yarmouth should stop at Berney Arms Station on
Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday in every week; but he should also
order that each of the companies should pay &pound;100 to the
plaintiff by way of costs.&nbsp; But for the plaintiff&rsquo;s
forbearance in this respect, it would be difficult to say whether
the Eastern Counties Company would have escaped from the
litigation with having nothing else to pay than the
plaintiff&rsquo;s ordinary costs.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The Norwich Operatic Union gave its second concert,
at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The programme included
&ldquo;Norma&rdquo; and selections from &ldquo;Il
Trovatore.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Mdlle.
Paripa, Mdlle. Vaneri, Mr. Santley, and Mr. Swift.&nbsp; Mr.
Bunnett, B.M., conducted.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The first of a series of special services was
conducted at Norwich Theatre, by the Rev. T. B. Stephenson,
Wesleyan minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boxes were reserved for the
most respectable-looking, and the unmitigated plebs. were
relegated to the pit and gallery.&nbsp; The occupants of the
gallery conducted themselves as the gods usually do, and were
rebuked by the preacher, who took up his position on the stage in
front of the drop scene, surrounded by a number of persons of
both sexes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;This was the coldest Christmas that had been
experienced for at least a century.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the Literary
Institute at Norwich the minimum <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>registered was 3 degrees above
zero.&nbsp; At Costessey the register was 7 degrees below zero,
or 39 degrees lower than the point at which water freezes.&nbsp;
A peculiarity of the temperature on Christmas-day was the fact of
its being colder in the morning than during the night.&nbsp; The
coldest register was between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., and there was
scarcely any appreciable variation till after two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Ice was about four inches thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The pantomime at Norwich Theatre was entitled,
&ldquo;Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper and the Fairy
Godmother from the Realms of Golden Palms.&rdquo;&nbsp;

Amphitheatre, Golden Ball Street, under the management of Messrs.
Emidy and Moffatt.&nbsp; The lessee was Mr. C. Testar.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died at 36, Berkeley Square, London, in his 57th
year, Dr. Edward Rigby.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of the
celebrated Dr. Rigby, of Norwich, and was educated at the Grammar

subsequently commenced practice in London, where he gradually
raised himself to the very highest branches of his
profession.</p>
<h3>1861.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;At the annual meeting of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association, held at the Swan Hotel, Norwich, Mr. Clare Sewell
Read moved that the annual show for 1861 be held at East Dereham,
instead of at Swaffham.&nbsp; This effort to abolish the system
of holding the exhibitions alternately at Norwich and Swaffham
was defeated by 19 votes to 15.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The frost continued with unusual intensity, and on
this day snowstorms, which covered the ground to the depth of
twelve inches, occurred.&nbsp; On the 10th a public meeting was
held at Norwich, under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. W. J.
Utten Browne), at which a fund was inaugurated to relieve the
distresses of the poor.&nbsp; In a few days the sum of
&pound;4,139 12s. 11d. was subscribed.&nbsp; The river was frozen
from Norwich to Yarmouth, and on the 16th a large party of ladies
and gentlemen assembled on the ice on Breydon and
&ldquo;skated&rdquo; quadrilles.&nbsp; The frost continued for
more than five weeks, during the whole of which period the ground
was covered with snow.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Walsingham Quarter Sessions were held for the last
time.&nbsp; Sir Willoughby Jones, who presided, informed the
Grand Jury that the Sessions would be removed part to Swaffham
and part to Norwich, &ldquo;on account of the expenses being so
great in proportion to the number of prisoners for
trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; On March lst the Bridewell ceased to be used
as a house of correction, and the prisoners were removed to
Norwich Castle.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>16.&mdash;Died, aged 85, Mr. Kinnebrook, for many years
a proprietor of the &ldquo;Norwich Mercury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died, in his 60th year, Mr. Thomas Lound, for 35
years confidential clerk at King Street Old Brewery,
Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;As an artist, but principally as a painter
in water-colours, he had maintained a high reputation for many
years.&nbsp; The local river and rural scenery afforded materials
for a large proportion of his works.&nbsp; He occasionally
painted street scenes and monastic ruins, and of late years he
made excursions into Wales and Yorkshire, bringing home with him
a vast variety of subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to his own
collection, he left many water-colour drawings by Bright,
Thirtle, Cox, and others, some of them of considerable value.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At Norwich Castle, James Blomfield Rush, aged 30,
&ldquo;eldest son of <i>the</i> Rush,&rdquo; was committed for
trial on the charge of breaking into the dwelling-house of Mr.
Abraham Cannell, farmer, Cringleford, on the night of January
12th.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Assizes, on March 27th, before Chief
Baron Pollock, the prisoner was acquitted.&nbsp; At subsequent
dates he was twice acquitted for housebreaking, but at the
Norfolk Quarter Sessions on March 11th, 1862, was sentenced to
four years&rsquo; penal servitude for breaking into a house at
North Tuddenham.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>13.&mdash;In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, before the Lord
Chief Justice and a special jury, an action was brought by Mr.
Costerton, solicitor, of Yarmouth, against Sir Edmund Lacon,
M.P., for a scandalous attack made upon the plaintiff by the
defendant in the course of an election speech.&nbsp; The jury
returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages 40s.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Judgment was given by the Barons of the Exchequer in
the cause Morant <i>v.</i> Chamberlin.&nbsp; It was an action
between the Corporation of Yarmouth and Mr. G. D. Palmer, who
claimed a right to a portion of the south end of the public
quays.&nbsp; Judgment was for the plaintiff, damages &pound;5
5s.&nbsp; &ldquo;This decision thus settles this long-pending
dispute, now nearly three years from its commencement, and
decides the right of the Corporation to the soil of the quays and
the right of the public to the free use of the same without any
of the inconveniences which for so long a time prevented the
proper enjoyment of the part in dispute.&nbsp; The verdict gives
the plaintiffs the costs of this heavy litigation, except on two
unimportant issues.&nbsp; The defendant will have to pay
somewhere about &pound;2,800.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>16.&mdash;On this date was published the announcement that the
First Norfolk Mounted Rifle Volunteer Corps had been attached to
the City of Norwich Rifle Volunteer Corps for administrative
purposes.&nbsp; The mounted corps, which numbered 50, was
commanded by Capt. F. Hay Gurney.&nbsp; The uniform consisted of
scarlet tunic with blue facings, white cross belt, white
breeches, and Napoleon boots.&nbsp; The head-dress was a busby
with blue bag; the forage-cap was blue trimmed with white.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>16.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Norwich of the
death, of the Duchess of Kent.&nbsp; On the 17th (Sunday) special
references were made to the melancholy event at the religious
services in the city, and at intervals the age of the deceased
was tolled upon the muffled bells of the Cathedral and St. Peter
Mancroft church.&nbsp; The Town Council, on April 5th, adopted an
address of sympathy with the Queen.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Surlingham estate was sold by Messrs. Butcher, at
the Royal Hotel, Norwich, for &pound;16,895.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Chief Baron Pollock
and a special jury, was tried the libel action, Cufaude <i>v.</i>
Cory.&nbsp; The plaintiff and defendant had taken different sides
at the election of a vestry clerk at Yarmouth, and the libel was
contained in a handbill issued during the contest by the
defendant, who referred to the printed statement of the income
and expenditure of the Guardians, to which body the plaintiff was
clerk, as &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; and left the sum of &pound;779
unaccounted for.&nbsp; The special jury returned a verdict for
plaintiff, damages &pound;500.&nbsp; In the Court of
Queen&rsquo;s Bench, on April 17th, Mr. Lush moved for a rule to
set aside the verdict, on the ground of excessive damages.&nbsp;
A rule was granted.&nbsp; Mr. Cufaude subsequently consented to a
reduction of damages from &pound;500 to &pound;300, &ldquo;much
against the advice of his counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;The High Sheriff of Norfolk (Mr. J. T. Mott)
delivered a lecture at Noverre&rsquo;s Rooms, Norwich, on
&ldquo;The Paston Letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The 10th Hussars Steeplechases took place at

33,717 males, and 40,697 females; total, 74,414.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;A serious military riot took place at Yarmouth,
between men of the Royal Artillery and of the East Norfolk
Militia.&nbsp; Belts and stones were freely used.&nbsp; A party
of 200 Artillerymen, armed with swords and knives, issued from
the arsenal, and were going to the assistance of their comrades,
when Mr. R. Steward, by persuasion and threats, kept the greater
portion from proceeding further.&nbsp; Officers of both corps
exerted themselves to quell the disturbance, and strong pickets
were stationed at the bridge, to prevent the Artillery from
entering Yarmouth and the Militia from crossing to Southtown.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>13.&mdash;The Norwich Grammar School athletic sports were held
for the first time.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>18.&mdash;A memorial was presented to the Norwich Town
Council, by farmers, graziers, dealers, &amp;c., praying the
Corporation to enlarge the Cattle Market.&nbsp; The Market
Committee recommended the Council to adopt in its entirety a plan
for executing the work, at a cost not exceeding
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; This scheme involved the demolition of the
notorious locality known as Pump Street.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Ringer, of Walcot Green, near Diss,
left their house in charge of a servant, named Susan Garrod, and
on their return in the evening found her suffering from several
gunshot wounds in the head and face, inflicted by a man named
Charles Sheldrake, a returned convict, employed as a groom and
gardener by Mr. Ringer.&nbsp; Sheldrake, after committing the
deed, secreted himself in a wood.&nbsp; On being called on by the
police to surrender, he placed the muzzle of a double-barrelled
gun to his mouth and blew out his brains.&nbsp; At the inquest
the jury returned a verdict of <i>felo de se</i>, and the Coroner
gave a warrant for the interment of the body between the hours of
nine and twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;The body was
accordingly buried at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, under one of
the paths in the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The London Royal English Opera Company commenced a
week&rsquo;s engagement at Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; The repertory
included &ldquo;four new successful operas never before performed
in Norwich,&rdquo; namely, Balfe&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Rose of
Castille,&rdquo; Loder&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Night Dancers,&rdquo;
Macfarren&rsquo;s &ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; and Balfe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Satanella, or the Power of Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition
to the above-named works, &ldquo;Il Trovatore,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maritana&rdquo; were
produced.&nbsp; The <i>artistes</i> included Miss Fanny Ternan,
Miss Bronte, Miss Angel, Miss Fanny Reeves, Mr. Edmund Rosenthal,
Mr. J. Manley, Mr. E. D. Corri, Mr. Oliver Summers, and Mr.
Elliott Galer.&nbsp; Mr. W. Meyer Lutz was the conductor.&nbsp;

against some of the best players in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; He
won eight games, lost three, and two were drawn.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Died, at Feniton Court, Devonshire, the Right Hon.
Sir John Patteson.&nbsp; The second son of the Rev. Henry
Patteson, and nephew of Mr. John Patteson, who for some time
represented Norwich in Parliament, he was born in that city on
February 11th, 1790.&nbsp; He was educated at Eton and
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and, after talking his degree,
removed to London and entered at the Middle Temple.&nbsp; On
being called to the Bar, he went the Northern Circuit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He had been only nine years a barrister, he had not a silk
gown, he had never led a cause or once addressed a jury,&rdquo;
when he was appointed to the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, and from that
time to February 11th, 1852, continued to discharge the duties of
his high office with a reputation for industry, learning, and
integrity.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>20.*&mdash;&ldquo;The first number of the <span
class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> was published on the 18th
of July, 1761.&nbsp; We are, therefore, as journalists, exactly
100 years old. . . .&nbsp; The difference between the newspapers
of <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the
last and present century is, perhaps, more conspicuous in the
quantity of space occupied than in any other respect, and the
present sheet is at least four times the size of our first
publication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;The repairs at St. Gregory&rsquo;s church,
Norwich, the interior of which has been undergoing general
restoration, have brought to light an interesting fresco,
representing the renowned fight between St. George and the
Dragon, a subject which has a local association, St. George being
the titular saint of the city and patron of a once flourishing
civic company.&nbsp; The painting, which, in all probability, is
of a date of the middle of the fifteenth century, was discovered
on the removal of the organ at the west end of the north aisle,
for the purpose of cleaning the wall.&nbsp; The figures are
life-size, and the colours and drawing exceedingly
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Chief Justice Erle and a
special jury, a libel action, Lane <i>v.</i> the Yarmouth Free
Press and Printing Company, Limited, was tried.&nbsp; Damages
were laid at &pound;300.&nbsp; The declaration alleged that the
defendants published in a paper called the &ldquo;Yarmouth
Independent,&rdquo; certain reflections upon the plaintiff in his
capacity as collector of market tolls.&nbsp; The defendants
contended that, at the request of and by agreement with the
plaintiff, they had inserted in the newspaper a paragraph
explaining the alleged libel, and had exonerated him from the
imputations made against his character, and plaintiff had
accepted it as satisfaction.&nbsp; The case ended with the
withdrawal of a juror.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Died at the residence of his son-in-law, 48, Elgin
Crescent, Notting Hill, in his 84th year, Philip John Money,
formerly captain of the 17th Regiment.&nbsp; He was a magistrate
of Norwich, and served the office of Mayor in 1839.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;The celebrated tight-rope walker, Blondin, made his
first appearance at Norwich.&nbsp; The rope was fixed at an
altitude of about 60 feet, in a field on Newmarket Road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a very fortunate circumstance for M. Blondin that he
crossed Niagara and had the Prince of Wales for a spectator, for
it has added a much greater interest to has performances than
they would otherwise have acquired, and even, if we may judge
from what we saw here, they deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Mr. Edward Casson, aged 33, medical superintendent of
the County Lunatic Asylum at Thorpe St. Andrew, committed suicide
by poisoning himself.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Holy Trinity church, Norwich, was consecrated by the
Lord Bishop of the Diocese.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ceremony should have
taken place three weeks previously, but at the eleventh hour the
Bishop requested that a capital fund of about &pound;300 should
be provided prior to the consecration.&nbsp; As the committee
were then about &pound;1,000 in debt, it was felt to be
indiscreet to increase their risk, and consequently it was
determined to delay the opening of the church until they had
received nearly all that they required.&nbsp; In less than three
weeks more than &pound;1,200 had been subscribed out of the
&pound;1,300 then supposed to be needed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
consecration was attended by the Mayor (Mr. W. J. Utten Browne)
and several members of the Corporation.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>29.&mdash;A troop of the 15th Hussars left Norwich,
<i>en route</i> to York; the remainder of the regiment marched on
September 3rd.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>12.&mdash;A great review of the whole of the Volunteer
Companies in the county and city, with the Norwich Mounted
Volunteers and the Yarmouth Artillery, was held at Holkham Park,
by Major-General Sir Archdale Wilson, Bart., K.C.B.&nbsp; This
was the first occasion on which the corps had been brigaded since
their formation.&nbsp; The review was fixed for eleven
o&rsquo;clock, but in consequence of a breakdown in the railway
arrangements, and the consequent detention of companies on their
way to the <i>rendezvous</i>, the parade was not formed until
2.15 p.m.&nbsp; The troops numbered upwards of 1,700, and were
divided into two brigades, commanded respectively by Lieut.-Col.
Custance and Major the Hon. F. Walpole, West Norfolk
Militia.&nbsp; The railway company displayed the same
incompetency in conveying the corps from Holkham as in taking
them there, and the Norwich men did not reach the city until six
o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The headquarters of the 5th Dragoon Guards arrived
at Norwich Cavalry Barracks, from Aldershot.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
known in the service as the &lsquo;Green Horse,&rsquo; being the
only cavalry regiment which wears green facings.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>13.&mdash;Died, Sir William Cubitt, the eminent
engineer.&nbsp; Born in Norfolk, in 1785, he was apprenticed to a
joiner, and, becoming a very superior handicraftsman, he rapidly
took a prominent position as a maker of agricultural
implements.&nbsp; Within a short time he became a millwright, and
about 1807 invented self-regulating windmill sails, and
ultimately became connected with Messrs. Ransome and Son, of
Ipswich.&nbsp; He was the inventor also of the treadmill for
gaols and houses of correction.&nbsp; His reputation increasing
his engagements, it became necessary for him to remove to the
Metropolis in 1826, and after that period there was scarcely a
port, harbour, dock, navigable river, or canal in the United
Kingdom with which he was not in some way engaged.&nbsp; The
South-Eastern Railway from London to Dover was designed and
executed by him.&nbsp; He undertook the bold project of blowing
away the face of the Round Down cliff, which he successfully
executed by exploding 18,000 lbs. of gunpowder in one blast, and
precipitated one million tons of chalk cliff into the sea.&nbsp;
The great landing-stage at Liverpool, the deck of which was
nearly one acre in extent, was a unique example of his
work.&nbsp; As consulting engineer of the Great Northern Railway,
he materially contributed to the production of one of the best
lines in England.&nbsp; One of his last public works was the
superintendence of the construction of the palace for the Great
Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851, which he undertook at the
pressing instance of his coadjutors on the Royal Commission, and
his services were recognised in a marked manner by the Queen and
the Prince Consort.</p>

<p>24.&mdash;Died, suddenly, of apoplexy, at his residence, West
Parade, Earlham Road, Norwich, in his 46th year, Mr. Edward
Garrod, editor of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk

<p>28.&mdash;Charles Dickens gave the former of two readings at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich.&nbsp; The work selected was
&ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 29th he read
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby at Mr. Squeer&rsquo;s School,&rdquo; and
the Trial scene from the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our opinion is,&rdquo; the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span> remarked, &ldquo;that Mr. Dickens as a reader
fails to do justice to himself as an author.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened, under the management of
Mr. George Owen.&nbsp; Mr. Sidney, however, retained the
lesseeship.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Died at Hingham, in her 100th year, Mrs. Rebecca
Houchen.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The new Corn Hall at Norwich was opened for
business.&nbsp; The contractors for the building were Messrs.
Ling and Balls, of Norwich, and for the roof Messrs. Barnard,
Bishop, and Barnards.&nbsp; The total cost was about
&pound;8,000.&nbsp; The work was executed from the designs of Mr.
Barry, of Norwich, and Mr. H. Butcher, of 37, Bedford Row,
London; and the roofs were adapted and carried into detail from
the design of the architects by Mr. E. A. Cowper, C.E., of
Westminster.&nbsp; The first brick of the new building was laid
on May 1st, 1861.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. John Oddin Taylor was elected Mayor, and Mr.
Addison John Cresswell appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Died at North Runcton Rectory, in his 85th year, the
Rev. James Cumming, M.A., professor of chemistry in the
University of Cambridge, to which office he was elected in
1815.&nbsp; He was a Fellow of Trinity College, and had held the
living of North Runcton for more than forty years.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;In the Court of the Lords Justices in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, a petition was presented by Major-General
Charles Ash Windham, Capt. Windham, the Marquis of Bristol, Lord
Alfred Hervey, M.P., Lord Listowel, and others, praying that a
writ <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i> might issue against William
Frederick Windham.&nbsp; In support of the petition, affidavits
were read which alleged a variety of eccentricities and
extravagances on the part of William Frederick Windham, and laid
great stress upon a marriage he had contracted with one Agnes Ann
Rogers, better known by the name of Agnes Willoughby.&nbsp; The
judges, after hearing the affidavits on the other side,
considered that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out, and
allowed the prayer of the petition.&nbsp; On December 4th, in the
Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court, a motion was heard for the
committal of Mr. James Bowen May for contempt of court, in
having, during the infancy of William Frederick Windham, and
without the knowledge of his guardian or the sanction of the
Court, drawn or sided and abetted in drawing the said William
Frederick Windham into a promise of marriage with Agues Rogers or
Willoughby, in which promises had been made of settlements or
dispositions of his property <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>in her favour.&nbsp; The motion was
refused, with costs.&nbsp; On December 11th the Court of Chancery
granted leave to William Frederick Windham to raise as a mortgage
charge on his property the sum of &pound;2,000, in order that he
might defend himself before the Commission.&nbsp; The Commission
held its first sitting in the Court of Exchequer, Westminster, on
December 16th, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel Warren, Q.C.,
one of the Masters in Lunacy.&nbsp; Mr. Windham was the only son
of Mr. Howe Windham, who died in 1854, and the great-grandson of
Mr. Windham, the great politician.&nbsp; He became of age on
August 9th, 1861, when he succeeded to the Felbrigg Hall estate,
worth upwards of &pound;1,200 a year, and to other properties in
which he had a life interest, and which, in the year 1869, would
yield him &pound;9,000 a year more.&nbsp; During his minority he
was under the guardianship of his uncle, General Windham, and of
his mother, Lady Sophia Hervey.&nbsp; He married a woman of loose
character, upon whom he bestowed jewellery of the value of
&pound;1,200 or &pound;1,400, and upon whom he settled a present
annuity of &pound;800, with a further annuity of &pound;1,500
contingent upon his coming in to the whole of his property in
1869.&nbsp; It was also alleged that he sold, in a wild and
reckless way, and upon terms of the utmost disadvantage, the
whole of the timber, ornamental as well as useful, on the
Felbrigg estate.&nbsp; The inquiry lasted thirty-four days, and
upwards of 150 witnesses were examined.&nbsp; It is said to have
cost something like &pound;160 per hour, or nearly &pound;3 per
minute, for all the leading talent of the Bar of England was
engaged in the case.&nbsp; On January 30th, 1862, the jury
returned the following verdict: &ldquo;That the said Mr. William
Frederick Windham, at the time of taking this inquisition, was a
person of sound mind, so as to be sufficient for the government
of himself, his manners, his messuages, his lands, his tenements,
his goods, and his chattels.&rdquo;&nbsp; The moment the verdict
was uttered a loud and enthusiastic cheer rose from the audience,
and was repeated again and again.&nbsp; When Mr. Windham left the
Court he was received outside with the shouts of an admiring
crowd, who almost carried him to the cab in which he drove away,
amid a deafening cheer.&nbsp; In the Court of Equity, on April
23rd, 1862, the Lords Justices refused to exonerate the alleged
lunatic from the payment of the whole of the costs, amounting to
&pound;20,000, consequent upon the enquiry.</p>

Eastern Counties, the Norfolk, the Eastern Union, the East
Anglian, and other railways&rsquo; communicating with Norwich
obtained publicity on this date.&nbsp; The Norwich Town Council,
on the 21st, decided to petition Parliament against the Railway
Amalgamation Bill, on the ground that the amalgamation was

<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Died at his house at Charlton, Kent, aged 86,
Professor Peter Barlow, F.R.S.&nbsp; He was born in the parish of
St. Simon, Norwich, in October, 1776.&nbsp; Related to one of the
leading manufacturing families in the city, the Columbines, his
early life was passed in their warehouse.&nbsp; He continued
there about three years, and during that period acquired, by his
own industry, a considerable knowledge of algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, navigation, and French.&nbsp; Subsequently he
obtained a situation in a school in Essex, and afterwards
proceeded to Shipdham, when, the master dying, he succeeded to
the school, and married a Shipdham lady.&nbsp; He commenced a
regular correspondence with the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo;
Diary,&rdquo; then under the management of Dr. Hutton, professor
of mathematics at Woolwich, whose attention was favourably
attracted by the contributions furnished by Mr. Barlow.&nbsp; Dr.
Hutton recommended him as candidate, in 1801, for the post of
additional master at the Royal Military Academy, and he was
successful.&nbsp; In 1811 he published his first work, &ldquo;The
Theory of Numbers,&rdquo; in 1813, &ldquo;The Mathematical
Dictionary,&rdquo; and in the same year his &ldquo;Mathematical
Tables.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1817 his work, &ldquo;The Strength of
Materials,&rdquo; was published.&nbsp; In 1819 he turned his
attention to magnetic experiments, in which he was very
successful in developing the laws of action and in the
application of those laws to the correction of a long-standing
error in navigation.&nbsp; For this discovery he received several
honorary and pecuniary rewards.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Essay on
Magnetic Attraction&rdquo; was published in 1819.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The new Poor Removal Act came into force.&nbsp; It

<p>31.&mdash;An accident occurred at a circus building at St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Gates, Norwich, hired by Mace and King, the
pugilists, for the purposes <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>of a benefit performance.&nbsp; The
rows of seats elevated one above the other and forming the pit
were densely crowded with spectators, whose weight broke the
frail supports, with the result that the centre of the pit fall
with its load of human beings.&nbsp; Many were severely bruised
and shaken, and one man, suffering from a broken leg, was removed
to the Hospital.</p>

presented to him by the students of Oxford, and set-to with young
Hicks, of Birmingham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heenan, the American pugilist,
brought a circus to Norwich on September 11th, and
&ldquo;apologised to the spectators for not sparring, as the
authorities had forbidden him, and it was only on giving this
promise that he was allowed to erect his tent on the Castle
Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mace&rsquo;s circus visited the city on
October 6th.&nbsp; &ldquo;The spectators were disappointed at the
non-appearance of Mace, the magistrates having forbidden him to
give an illustration of his noble art.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>3.*&mdash;&ldquo;Died last week, at Rackheath, Ph&oelig;be
Clayburn, at the advanced age of 103 years.&nbsp; She had 22
children, and her eldest son is now living at Bramerton, aged 80
years; her grandchild is 50; her great-grandchild is 20, and her
great-great-grandchild is now two years of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;The large tract of land known as the Middle Level of
the Fens, which had been greatly improved by the construction of
the Middle Level Drain, a small river which collected the waters
of the district and discharged them into the Ouse near Wiggenhall
St. German&rsquo;s, was inundated, in consequence of a breach in
the sluice erected at the point where the two streams
joined.&nbsp; The tide, no longer confined to the channel of the
Ouse, rushed up the drain, broke through the bank on the west
side at two places, and, in a wild torrent, overspread the
adjacent lands.&nbsp; Efforts were at once made to strengthen the
dams, by placing vast quantities of clinch and gravel at the foot
of the piles.&nbsp; On June 20th, a meeting of the owners and
occupiers of land was held at the Globe Hotel, Lynn, under the
presidency of the Rev. Henry ffolkes, at which resolutions were
passed requiring the Middle Level Commissioners to take prompt
and efficient measures to prevent the recurrence of such a
disaster.&nbsp; It was also agreed that more satisfactory means
for redress for damage should be given than were afforded by the
Middle Level Act, and that application be made to <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Parliament
for the insertion in the Middle Level Bill then before the House
of Lords of necessary provisions for securing both objects.&nbsp;
At the Norfolk Assizes, on July 29th, before Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn, commenced the long course of litigation resulting from
the inundation.&nbsp; Mr. William Mason, lessee of 18 acres of
land at Tilney All Saints, within the Marshland Fen district,
sued Mr. Wise, clerk to the Middle Level Commissioners, for the
recovery of &pound;500 damages sustained through the alleged
negligence of the Commissioners in making and maintaining the
Middle Level Sluice and Drain.&nbsp; Leave was given to both
sides to move in the Common Pleas or Queen&rsquo;s Bench for the
removal of the trial to London.&nbsp; On August 16th it was
announced that the expenses incident to the disaster were
estimated at about &pound;25,000, to meet which &pound;20,000 had
been taken up by way of temporary loan.&nbsp; A second disaster
occurred on October 4th.&nbsp; One of the outfall sluices of the
Marshland Smeeth and Fen Drain, an important arterial drain
running into the Ouse about 200 or 300 yards northward of the
ruined Middle Level Sluice, gave way, and again a wide extent of
country was submerged.&nbsp; Four hundred navvies were at once
set to work to form a dam of many thousands of sacks filled with
earth.&nbsp; On the 5th the temporary dam gave way bodily, and
the entire mass having been carried a score yards up the drain,
sank out of sight.&nbsp; The tidal water having overcome the
obstacle, went with a rush and a roar on its work of devastation,
carrying with it great quantities of earth and timber.&nbsp;
About 1,000 acres were flooded; 4,000 acres were under water
before the completion of another temporary dam on the 8th.&nbsp;
After that the water was removed by means of huge syphons.&nbsp;
On November 10th the Court of Common Pleas refused a rule for the
changing of the venue of the trial of the action, Mason <i>v.</i>
Wise, from Norfolk to Surrey, and with this decision ended the
first stage of the legal proceedings.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January
31st, 1863.)</p>
<p>5.&mdash;The Braham Grand English Opera Company commenced a

<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>11.&mdash;In the Divorce Court, before Sir C. Cresswell,
judgement was <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>given in the action, Burroughs <i>v.</i> Burroughs and
Silcock.&nbsp; This was a cross suit.&nbsp; Mrs. Burroughs prayed
for the restitution of conjugal rights, and her husband, in his
answer, charged her with adultery, and prayed for a judicial
separation.&nbsp; In the second case Mr. Burroughs prayed for a
dissolution of marriage, on the ground of his wife&rsquo;s
misconduct.&nbsp; The second case had been tried by a common jury
on March 6th, 7th, 8th, and 13th, and terminated in a verdict
that neither the petitioner, the respondent, nor the
co-respondent had been guilty of adultery.&nbsp; His lordship had
deferred judgment in the first suit, in order that his opinion
might not affect the opinion of the jury in the second suit,
which had not then been tried.&nbsp; He now said he thought Mrs.
Burroughs had misconducted herself, and he could not order her
husband to take her home again.&nbsp; He, therefore, dismissed
her petition for restitution.&nbsp; He refused, however, to
pronounce a decree of judicial separation, on the ground that as
the parties themselves had been examined, he could not treat the
husband&rsquo;s answer as a counter petition.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;At Swaffham County Court, a jury was engaged in the
trial of an action, Green <i>v.</i> Sayers.&nbsp; The plaintiff,
a shoemaker, sought to recover &pound;25 damages for an assault
by the defendant, described as &ldquo;a circus proprietor, but
better known as the ex-champion of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; The case
excited great local interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;The defendant,&rdquo;
it was said, &ldquo;conducted himself with a degree of modesty,
propriety, and decorum that caused no little feeling in his
favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; The assault arose out of a dispute as to the
withholding of change alleged to be due to the plaintiff on money
tendered for admission to the defendant&rsquo;s show, and the
jury gave a verdict for Green, damages &pound;5.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A great Volunteer review took place at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; The first brigade of 910 men was commanded by
Lieut.-Col. Astley, Norfolk Artillery; the second (1,230 men) by
Lieut.-Col. Sir E. Lacon, Bart., M.P., and the third (350 men) by
Lieut.-Col. Custance.&nbsp; The reviewing officer was Col. Guy,

<p>&mdash;An extraordinary fight took place between a bull and a
stallion, both the property of Mr. James Coker.&nbsp; The animals
were grazing in a field near the Chase at King&rsquo;s Lynn, and
became engaged in a deadly combat, which ended in the bull
disembowelling the horse with its horns.&nbsp; The stallion was
valued at &pound;60.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The marriage of H.R.H. Princess Alice and the Grand
Duke of Hesse was celebrated throughout the county with great
rejoicing.&nbsp; The day was observed at Norwich as a public
holiday; at a special meeting of the Town Council a

116</span>bail on the charge of &ldquo;having by fraud in playing
with cards won the sum of 14s., the money of Samuel Boughton, at
the Star Inn, Haymarket, Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were other
counts, charging the defendant with defrauding other persons by
the same means.&nbsp; Mr. Serjeant Ballantyne, specially
retained, succeeded in obtaining a verdict of not guilty.&nbsp;
The Recorder observed: &ldquo;Well, prisoner, you have had a most
merciful jury; that is all I can say.&rdquo;&nbsp; The defendant
was cheered as he left the Court.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The first of the peripatetic shows of the Norfolk
Agricultural Association was held at East Dereham.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The cautious and timid members of the Norfolk Association
who prophesied that so many dark and dreadful events would happen
to the society if absolved from her marriage vow which wedded her
entirely to Norwich, and Swaffham, must have been pleasantly
surprised by the entire success of the Dereham
meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; So great was the rush to the show-ground
that more than once the barrier was broken down.&nbsp; The sum of
&pound;230 was taken in admission money, whereas it had never
before amounted to &pound;150, and rarely exceeded &pound;80.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Mr. Henry Stevenson, one of the proprietors of the

<p>&mdash;Died, in London, Mr. H. L. Styleman le Strange.&nbsp;
He was the only son of Mr. Henry Styleman, of Snettisham Hall,
where he was born in 1815.&nbsp; Educated at Eton and at
Christchurch, Oxford, he travelled, on the completion of his
University career, in Egypt, and, returning home in 1836, his
majority was celebrated at Hunstanton Hall, the ancient residence
of the le Stranges.&nbsp; In 1839 he procured the Royal licence
to assume the patronymic surname of le Strange, in addition to
that of Styleman, and in the same year married Jamesina Joice
Ellen, daughter of Mr. John Stewart, of Balladrum, Inverness, by
whom he left issue two sons and three daughters.&nbsp; Mr. le
Strange, acceding to the request of the Conservative party, stood
for the Western division of the county, and was defeated by a
small majority.&nbsp; He left the hustings with the promise that
at the next election he would again offer himself; he kept his
promise, but eventually withdrew, and retired from
politics.&nbsp; He then commenced his great work of painting the
roof of Ely Cathedral, on the design and execution of which he
bestowed many years of hard toil.&nbsp; At his death the work was
about half completed, and he had only recently received
recognition of his artistic talents by being appointed a member
of a commission for investigating the state of the frescoes in
the new Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; Hunstanton church is a
monument to his taste and skill.&nbsp; Mr. le Strange was senior
co-heir to the baronies of Hastings and Foliot, and co-heir to
those of Camoys and Strathbolgie.&nbsp; He had served the office
of High Sheriff of Norfolk, was a magistrate and deputy
lieutenant, and a director of the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway

fellow-passenger, and having re-ascended to the height of 12,000
feet, finally came to earth in Mr. Trafford&rsquo;s park at
Wroxham.&nbsp; Mr. Simmons made another ascent from the Orchard

cup of the value of &pound;30, took place on Figg&rsquo;s Cricket
Ground, Newmarket Road, Norwich.&nbsp; Previous performances of
Brighten and Deerfoot had given rise to suspicion as to the
genuineness of these contests, but on this occasion it was
announced that &ldquo;Deerfoot&rsquo;s career in England being
about to terminate,&rdquo; the race would be a legitimate trial
of speed.&nbsp; Brighten won by 30 yards, in 54 minutes, 30

Stafford.&nbsp; Her ladyship was an American by birth, one of
four daughters of Mr. C. Caton, of Baltimore.&nbsp; So remarkable
were the sisters for their personal charms, that they were known
as &ldquo;the beauties of Baltimore,&rdquo; a reputation which
had the effect of securing for three of them British coronets,
one as the Duchess of Leeds, another as the Marchioness
Wellesley, and the third as the Baroness Stafford.&nbsp; She
became the second wife of the 8th Lord Stafford in 1837.</p>

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>21.&mdash;Died at his residence, Thorpe Hamlet, aged 82, Mr.
John Skipper, who had filled several offices under the old
Corporation of Norwich, including those of Speaker and
Chamberlain.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died at Trumpington Street, Cambridge, Mr. S. D.
Colkett, artist, formerly of Norwich.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;The litigation arising from the inundation in
Marshland commenced on this date with the hearing, in the
Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court, of an application for a mandamus
to compel the Middle Level Commissioners to restore the paling
path over the breach made by the inundations.&nbsp; At the
suggestion of the Court, it was agreed that the only question in
dispute, that of legal liability, should be raised as a special
case.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Assizes, on April 1st, before Lord
Chief Justice Erle, two actions, Mason <i>v.</i> Wise and Coe
<i>v.</i> Wise (clerk to the Middle Level Commissioners), were
down for trial by special jury.&nbsp; It was understood that
these cases, which were brought for the recovery of damages
consequent upon the inundation, were selected out of a total of
107 causes in which writs had been issued.&nbsp; In the action
Coe <i>v.</i> Wise, the declaration alleged that by a certain Act
of Parliament the Middle Level Commissioners were bound to make
and maintain a certain cut, bank, and sluices; it was complained
that, in consequence of their negligence, the tidal waters burst
through them and flooded the lands of the plaintiff.&nbsp; The
defendant entered a plea of not guilty, and alleged that the
plaintiff was not possessed of the lands.&nbsp; The hearing of
the case occupied four days.&nbsp; The Judge, in summing up,
directed the jury to decide whether the damage was caused to the
plaintiff by the absence of due care and skill on the part of the
defendants, (1) in respect of the making of the sluice; (2) in
respect of maintaining the sluice; (3) in respect of providing
remedies against mishap after the sluice was destroyed; and (4)
was damage caused to the plaintiff by reason that no puddled wall
was made along both banks of the cut?&nbsp; The jury found for
the defendant on the first point, and for the plaintiff on the
other three points.&nbsp; In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, on
April 18th, Mr. Fitzroy Kelly moved for a rule calling upon
plaintiff to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside
and entered for the defendant, on the ground of misdirection, and
that the verdict was against the evidence.&nbsp; Lord Chief
Justice Cockburn said the Court would grant a rule upon the
question of law involved, but not as regarded the evidence,
because their lordships found that Lord Chief Justice Erle was
satisfied with the verdict.&nbsp; The case was again before the
Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench on November 19th, and, alter two
days&rsquo; argument, was ordered to stand over until the next
term.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 21st, 1864.)</p>

snow.&nbsp; In his match with Mills he was beaten by 20 yards, in
4 minutes 34 seconds.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;The Norwich Poor-law Amendment Bill was considered by
a Committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; Its object was to
repeal the Act passed in 1831, &ldquo;for the better management
of the several parishes and hamlets of the city and county of the
city of Norwich&rdquo;; to substitute another body for the
Incorporation of Guardians; and to introduce certain clauses for
the equalisation of the rates between the city and hamlets; and
for the inclusion of the Cathedral Close, which was not then
within the jurisdiction of the Guardians.&nbsp; The Bill passed
through Committee on March 12th, and was directed to be reported
to the House.&nbsp; The last meeting of the old Court of
Guardians was held at the Guildhall, Norwich, on October 6th, and
its existence as a corporate body expired on the 22nd, when the
new Board was elected.&nbsp; Prior to the election, a meeting,
presided over by the Mayor (Mr. Patteson), was held, at which was
passed a resolution to the effect that, &ldquo;considering the
excessive poor-rates which have pressed upon this city for so
many years, and the abuses which have sprung up in the
administration of the Poor-law, it is incumbent upon the
ratepayers to sink party and other differences and co-operate for
carrying out the new Act with integrity and
impartiality.&rdquo;</p>

Bless the Prince of Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; The military were
entertained at luncheon in a marquee erected on the parade-ground
at the Militia Barracks; the Sheriff (Mr. Colman) gave a dinner
to the aged poor, at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and 14,403 Sunday
school children were entertained.&nbsp; At night the city was
illuminated, a firework display took place on the Castle Meadow,
and the proceedings concluded with the lighting of a huge bonfire
opposite the Shirehall.&nbsp; Similar celebrations took place at
Yarmouth and Lynn, and festivities were held in all the smaller
towns and villages in the county.&nbsp; At a special meeting of
the Norwich Town Council on the 12th, congratulatory addresses
were voted to the Queen and to the Prince and <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Princess of
Wales, and it was announced that many of the textile
manufacturers had decided to present to her Royal Highness
articles of home manufacture.&nbsp; The citizens gave the famous
&ldquo;Norwich Gates&rdquo; exhibited at the Great Exhibition,
which were purchased by public subscription and afterwards
erected at Sandringham.&nbsp; A county meeting was held at the
Shirehall on the 14th, and congratulatory addresses
adopted.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses arrived at their Norfolk
home on March 28th.&nbsp; At Lynn railway station the Mayor (Mr.
L. W. Jarvis) presented an address, and from Wolferton station to
Sandringham the Prince and Princess were escorted by the Norfolk
Light Horse, commanded by Capt. Hay Gurney, and by a large body
of mounted tenantry.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at Brentwood, Mr. Edward Taylor, professor of
music at Gresham College, London, aged 79.&nbsp; He was a native
of Norwich, and a son of Mr. John Taylor, who occupied a
prominent position in the city as a wool and yarn factor, and
displayed considerable literary and musical abilities.&nbsp; Mr.
Edward Taylor had been many years resident in London, but he
constantly attended the Norwich Musical Festivals, in the
establishment of which he took a leading part, and was a frequent
vocal performer.&nbsp; He was a pleasing composer, and some of
his songs met with deserved appreciation.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Professor J. H. Pepper lectured at Noverre&rsquo;s
Rooms, Norwich, on &ldquo;Optical Illusions,&rdquo; and for the
first time exhibited in the city the now well-known illusion,
&ldquo;Pepper&rsquo;s Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The Yarmouth Gas Bill, the object of which was to
incorporate the Great Yarmouth Gas Company and to make further
provision for lighting the town and certain neighbouring places
with gas, was considered by a Committee of the House of
Lords.&nbsp; The Bill was read a third time in that House on the
24th, and passed.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;Died at Wakefield Lodge, Northamptonshire, his Grace
the Duke of Grafton.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of George Henry,
fourth Duke, by Charlotte Maria Waldegrave, second daughter of
James, second Earl Waldegrave and Maria, who afterwards became
Duchess of Gloucester.&nbsp; Born on February 10th, 1790, he
married, on June 20th, 1812, Mary Caroline, third daughter of
Admiral the Hon. Sir George Cranfield Berkeley.&nbsp; He
represented Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s from 1826 to 1830, and had a
seat in the Lower House for Thetford from 1834 to September,
1844.&nbsp; By his death, his eldest son, the Earl of Euston,
M.P. for Thetford since 1847, inherited the family honours.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;A remarkable charge of abduction was tried at the
Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Williams.&nbsp; Frederick
Burrell (21), a clerk employed at the Royal Arsenal, was indicted
&ldquo;for having, from motives of lucre, fraudulently allured,
taken away, and detained Jane Burrell, a person under 21 years of
age, she having a present legal interest in certain real estates
in Norfolk, out of the possession and against the will of her
mother, Mary Ann Hyder, and her guardian, William Silver Hyder,
with intent to marry her, on January 20th, 1863.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Henry Richard Burrell, his brother, was indicted for aiding and
abetting.&nbsp; The defendants were uncles of the girl, who was
the daughter of the eldest son of one Daniel Burrell, who died
without a will.&nbsp; As the eldest son died during Daniel
Burrell&rsquo;s lifetime, the daughter became possessed of all
his freehold property.&nbsp; The girl left school at Norwich at
Christmas, and went to Fakenham, but instead <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of staying
with her mother and stepfather, went to the house of Henry
Burrell, and on January 19th left for London with Frederick
Burrell.&nbsp; The next day they were married at Plumstead, near
Woolwich, the marriage licence obtained by Frederick Burrell
being, it was alleged, &ldquo;full of the grossest
perjury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict of guilty, but
sentence was deferred, pending the argument of certain points
before the Court for the consideration of Crown cases
reserved.&nbsp; The defendants, on April 25th, appealed against
their conviction, and the Court, after hearing arguments,
reserved judgment.&nbsp; The case came before the Court for the
consideration of Crown cases reserved, on November 24th.&nbsp;
Their lordships were divided in opinion, not upon any question of
law, but upon the facts of the case.&nbsp; Judgment was delivered
upon the opinion of the majority, who held that the facts did not
bear out that which was necessary to sustain a prosecution, and
therefore, &ldquo;with very great regret,&rdquo; they quashed the
conviction.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Died at Chester Terrace, Regent&rsquo;s Park, London,
Mr. John Taylor, F.R.S.&nbsp; Born at Norwich on August 22nd,
1779, he was trained as a land surveyor and engineer, and in 1798
was invited to take the management of a mine near
Tavistock.&nbsp; It proved very profitable.&nbsp; In 1803 he
projected and commenced the Tavistock Canal, of which about three
miles were tunnelled through a granite hill.&nbsp; The execution
of this work led to the discovery of two other mines, which
produced large quantities of copper, and yielded considerable
profits.&nbsp; The success of these and other mines in the
neighbourhood of Tavistock, in Cornwall, and in the North of
England, brought Mr. Taylor into great repute as a mining
engineer.&nbsp; He was the author of several useful papers on
mining, and one of the first to propose the formation of a Mining
School; he was, too, one of the earliest Fellows of the
Geological Society, and for many years acted as treasurer and
vice-president.&nbsp; In 1825 he was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society, and was one of the founders of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, of which organization
he was treasurer until 1862.&nbsp; An excellent portrait of Mr.
Taylor was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1825, and afterwards
engraved by Charles Turner.&nbsp; Another portrait was painted in
1861, by Mr. Sydney Hodges.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;At Norwich Police Court, Mr. Edward Manning, of
London Street, and Mr. William Edwards, of Sprowston, were
summoned for assaulting Jonas Dye, of Pockthorpe, in contesting
the question of common rights on Mousehold Heath.&nbsp; According
to Mr. Simms Reeve, who appeared for the prosecution, the Dean
and Chapter of Norwich owned the Heath, and the people of
Pockthorpe, whether they had the right or not, claimed common
rights.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter did not dispute those rights,
and the people not only used the Heath themselves, but let it to
others to graze their cattle, to take turf at so much per
hundred, and gravel at so much per load.&nbsp; The revenue formed
a common fund, managed by a committee elected each year at a
public meeting, at which the clergyman of the parish
presided.&nbsp; The defendants contested these rights, and
liberated stock which had been impounded.&nbsp; The Town Clerk
(Mr. Mendham) objected to the magistrates&rsquo; jurisdiction,
under 6th and 7th Vic., cap. 30, which provided that no justice
of the peace &ldquo;should hear and determine any case of assault
or battery in which any question should arise as to the title of
any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or the interest accruing
therefrom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The magistrates dismissed the case.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;A dreadful accident occurred at Yarmouth.&nbsp; Two

proposed that they should ascend the Nelson Monument.&nbsp; The
other agreed, and the ascent commenced, Marsh performing
&ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo; upon his violin, and Wharton
playing a banjo accompaniment.&nbsp; Arrived at the summit,
Marsh, who added to his other accomplishments that of a posturer,
scaled the stone fence on the platform, and, seizing the
lightning conductor, climbed upon the emblematic figure of
Britannia and there remained for ten minutes, singing and waving
his hands to the crowd beneath.&nbsp; In descending, he was
compelled to stoop head foremost to grasp the handle of
Britannia&rsquo;s trident.&nbsp; From some cause he slipped, fell
upon the plinth, and thence rebounded into space, falling with
arms outstretched to the base of the column, a depth of 144
feet.&nbsp; His death was instantaneous.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The official celebration of the Queen&rsquo;s

Frolic.&nbsp; A large wherry, named the Ruby, belonging to Mr.
England, of Limpenhoe, had been chartered for the day by a
Yarmouth publican, and was crowded with passengers both above and
below the hatches.&nbsp; The craft was sailing to the
<i>rendezvous</i>, and when between the Dickey-walk and the
Cross-stakes, the Red Rover, a famous yacht, was sighted <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>coming full
sail down the river.&nbsp; The passengers rushed hurriedly from
the larboard to the starboard side of the wherry, to watch her
progress, and those beneath the hatches protruded their heads and
necks over the gunwale.&nbsp; The stanchions, unable to resist
the sudden strain, gave way, and the hatches falling, came with
terrific force upon the heads and bodies of the persons
below.&nbsp; Two men, named Charles Aldis Rushmer and James
Tripp, had their necks dislocated and skulls fractured, several
persons sustained minor injuries, and others were thrown into the
water, but were rescued by boats.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;A serious fire occurred at East Dereham, on the
premises of Mr. William Hubbard, builder.&nbsp; It resulted in
the total destruction of the large workshops, and entailed a loss
of about &pound;2,000.&nbsp; An adjacent warehouse was stored
with &pound;400 worth of goods belonging to Mr. E. Smith was also
destroyed.&nbsp; Furniture and goods were hastily removed from
adjoining houses and placed in the Corn Hall; the tenants of Mrs.
Dingle&rsquo;s cottages suffered great loss from their articles
being broken or stolen.&nbsp; A public subscription was made to
recoup Mr. Hubbard&rsquo;s workmen the loss of their trade tools,
valued at about &pound;130; and on August 10th, at a meeting of
the townspeople, a fire brigade was organized.&nbsp; The origin
of the fire was never discovered.&nbsp; A groom in the employment

<p>2.&mdash;Died in London, Sir William Bellairs, of Mulbarton
Lodge, in his 70th year.&nbsp; From 1811 to 1819 he served in the
15th Hussars, and went through the campaigns of 1813 and
1814.&nbsp; He was present at Vittoria, the Pyrenees, Orthes,
Tarbes, Toulouse, and other engagements, and also served in the
campaign of 1815, had a horse killed under him in the retreat
from Quatre Bras, and received two wounds at the battle of
Waterloo.&nbsp; In 1837 he was appointed exon of the Yeomen of

Miss Hooke, daughter and heiress of Mr. Edmund Hooke, of
Mulbarton Lodge.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Died at his residence, St. Catherine&rsquo;s
Cottage, Norwich, in his 62nd year, Mr. William Matchett, senior
proprietor of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span>.&nbsp; He was the second son of Mr. Jonathan
Matchett, a former proprietor of the journal.&nbsp; Educated at
Norwich Grammar School, under the Rev. Dr. Valpy, he became a
partner in the establishment in 1827, from which time until his
death he took an active share in its management.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
former days, before the science of shorthand writing had become a
business in itself, Mr. Matchett, like his school-fellow and
contemporary, Mr. R. N. Bacon, performed for this newspaper all
those duties which the exigencies of the present age require
should be distributed amongst a &lsquo;staff of reporters,&rsquo;
and as the representative of the <span
class="smcap">Chronicle</span> attended most of the principal
meetings in the city and county, the proceedings at which were
ably condensed for the public eye by the aid of his brief notes
and singularly retentive memory.&nbsp; Under the old Corporation,
and for a short period under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, Mr.
Matchett was connected with the Norwich Town Council for upwards
of eight years, and at all times took a warm interest in the
welfare and improvement of his native city.</p>

Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, accompanied by Madame Fanny
Huddart, Herr Reichardt, Signor Ferranti, and MM. Vieuxtemps and
Ascher (violin and pianoforte).&nbsp; &ldquo;Mdlle. Patti had
been offered an engagement at the Festival, but had declined to
come unless she was paid 500 gs.&nbsp; The Festival Committee
were justified in rejecting her terms, which could only be
accorded to a second Jenny Lind, which she is not.&nbsp;
Nevertheless she is a wonderful singer.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>7.*&mdash;&ldquo;The gales that have visited the coast during
the last week have been terrific.&nbsp; For days there has been
an enormous fleet of southward bound colliers in Yarmouth
Roads.&nbsp; With other vessels, the coast, extending from
Caister to Corton, a distance of several miles, has been crowded
with shipping, and several shipwrecked crews have been landed at
the Sailors&rsquo; Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Norwich, in his 76th year, Mr. William Stark,
F.G.S.&nbsp; He was well-known in his day as an able chemist, and
was one of the first dyers of fabrics of Norwich manufacture,
&ldquo;particularly of the colour called Turkey red, the
manufacturers in the North sending large quantities of goods for
dyeing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He devoted much of his time to the
prosecution of scientific studies, and was a Fellow of the
Geological Society.&nbsp; In the days when Dr. Rigby, William
Taylor, Dalrymple, Crosse, C. Austrin, Dr. Evans, &amp;c.,
belonged to the Norwich Philosophical Society, Mr. Stark
contributed many papers at its meetings, in which he bore a
distinguished part.&nbsp; For many years he had been afflicted by
partial loss of sight, and a few months before his death became
totally blind.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Osborn Springfield was elected Mayor, and Mr.
Frederick Brown appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;A meeting for the promotion of the East Norfolk
Railway was held at the Swan Hotel, St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich,
under the presidency of Lord Suffield.&nbsp; A resolution
emphasising the importance of the scheme was adopted, and the
following motion was also unanimously passed: &ldquo;That the
offer of the Great Eastern Railway Company to render substantial
help in the formation of lines of railway to North Walsham,
Aylsham, and Cromer, and to work the same when made at 50 per
cent. upon the gross receipts, should be cordially accepted by
the district, as conferring the means of accomplishing public
works of the greatest benefit, and which otherwise must have been
indefinitely postponed.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> May 5th,
1864.)</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Mr. James Caird, M.P., Mr. G. Shaw Lefevre, M.P.,
and Professor T. H. Huxley, the Commissioners appointed to
enquire into the condition of the sea fisheries of the United
Kingdom, attended at the Sailors&rsquo; Home, Yarmouth, for the
purpose of hearing evidence.&nbsp; The objects of the inquiry
were to ascertain (1) whether the supply of fish from the
fisheries of the United Kingdom had increased of late years,
remained stationary, or diminished; (2) whether any of the
methods of catching fish involved the wasteful diminution of fish
spawn, and whether legislative interference was required to
increase the supply; and (3) whether any existing legislative
enactments <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>operated prejudicially against fisheries.&nbsp; The
Commissioners afterwards visited King&rsquo;s Lynn.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The death occurred at Yarmouth, in his 43rd year, of
Hales, the Norfolk Giant.&nbsp; He was born at West Somerton, and
for some years was engaged in seafaring pursuits, until his
enormous height, 7 ft. 6 inches, gained for him such notoriety
that he was induced to abandon the sea and exhibit himself.&nbsp;
During his nomadic career he visited almost every town in the
kingdom, and scarcely a fair was considered complete without the
huge yellow caravan which formed his temporary abode.&nbsp;
Becoming tired of his wandering life.&nbsp; Hales took up his
abode in London, and whilst there had the honour of appearing
before the Court and of receiving from the Queen a handsome gold
watch and chain.&nbsp; Shortly after his appearance at Court, the
fame of the Norfolk Giant reached Barnum, who lost no time in
engaging his services.&nbsp; Hales remained with Barnum for some
years, in the course of which he visited most of the cities and
towns in America.&nbsp; On his return to England he resumed his
wanderings, and, in the course of the summer of 1862 came to
Yarmouth, where his presence on the Britannia Pier attracted
large numbers of visitors.&nbsp; Hales&rsquo;s parents were
conspicuous for their great height, his father being 6 ft 6 ins.,
and his mother 6 ft.&nbsp; He had five sisters, who averaged 6 ft
6 ins.&nbsp; One of them, Mary, was 7 ft. 2 ins. in height, and
for some years travelled with her brother.&nbsp; She died in
Guernsey.&nbsp; His four brothers averaged 6 ft 5 inches.&nbsp; A
few days before his death, Hales was walking about Norwich, where
he attracted great crowds by his immense size.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Died at the Rectory, Long Stratton, Mr. George Birch
Jerrard, son of Major-General Jerrard.&nbsp; Born at Bodmin, on
November 24th, 1804, he acquired considerable fame as a
mathematician, and was the author of &ldquo;Mathematical
Researches&rdquo; and of &ldquo;An Essay on the Resolution of
Equations.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his first-named work, &ldquo;he made a
great step in Algebra, and one acknowledged by all
mathematicians, namely, the taking away of <i>three</i> terms
from equations of any degree.&nbsp; In his latter work he
maintains he has solved <i>the</i> great problem of Algebra,
namely, the resolution of <i>all</i> equations.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
the time of his death he was engaged in writing a work on
&ldquo;Prophecy,&rdquo; a subject in which he was greatly
interested.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Brother Ignatius, &ldquo;a clergyman of the English
Church, who has the temerity to come before a public audience
attired as a Benedictine monk, with bare head and bare feet,
carrying a rosary and crucifix, which in this country are
regarded as symbolic only of the Romish Church, and calling
himself by a name not accorded to him by his godfathers and
godmother,&rdquo; lectured at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich,
on &ldquo;Monks and Monasteries for the English
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 13th, 1864.)</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A gale of unusual violence began in the night, and
prevailed during the whole of the 3rd.&nbsp; There was hardly a
street in Norwich in which the roofs of houses escaped
damage.&nbsp; Many vessels were lost off the Norfolk coast.&nbsp;
One hundred and forty-four men and boys were drowned, and 68
widows and 105 children were left destitute.&nbsp; A <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>public
subscription, to which the Queen contributed &pound;100, was
opened at Yarmouth to relieve their distress.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;A meeting of weavers was held at Norwich, to consider
the rates of payment for work.&nbsp; It was stated that in 1846 a
list of prices was agreed to by the manufacturers and operatives
for all fabrics then made.&nbsp; These prices had, with few
exceptions, been maintained in Norwich, but a great deal of work
was sent into the country, where it was done at the reduced rate
of 5&frac12;d. per dozen skeins, or considerably more than 50 per
cent. difference.&nbsp; The weavers resolved that any departure
from the list of prices would be alike injurious to employers and
employed, and a deputation was appointed to wait upon the
manufacturers to enforce this view.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. David Fisher gave, at Noverre&rsquo;s Rooms,
Norwich, his entertainment, entitled, &ldquo;Facts and
Fancies,&rdquo; with which he had achieved great success during
the London season.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher was known in Norwich not only
as an excellent actor and accomplished musician, but as a
vocalist of much taste.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Baron Martin,
James Margatroyed Hubbard (24), described as a general dealer,
and son of a Norwich brewer, was indicted for forging a bill of
exchange for &pound;45, and sentenced to 20 years&rsquo; penal
servitude.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The weather was very mild.&nbsp; A picotee bloom and
rose were gathered in a garden at Norwich.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Mr. H. J. Byron was the author of the pantomime
produced at Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; It was entitled, &ldquo;Ali
Baba, or the Thirty-nine Thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A revolting performance was given at one of the shows
at the Norwich Christmas Fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man and woman, said
to be Kaffirs, actually fed upon live rats, in the presence of
continually succeeding audiences.&rdquo;&nbsp; The details, as
published in the newspaper, are too horrible to be quoted.&nbsp;
The Mayor, on being informed of the proceedings, prohibited the
exhibition, after which raw flesh was substituted for live
rats.&nbsp; At Walsingham, a few days afterwards, the show was
visited by many hundreds of country folk; at Wells the police
expelled the performers from the town.</p>
<h3>1864.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;The mild weather of Christmas week was succeeded by
frost of great intensity.&nbsp; On this day the thermometer stood
at 14 degrees, and the river above the New Mills at Norwich was
frozen.&nbsp; Large numbers of golden plover made their
appearance in the neighbourhood of Thetford, and an extraordinary
quantity of wild fowl came within the bounds of Shadwell, where
Sir Robert Buxton prohibited their being shot or molested.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>9.&mdash;Early in the morning intelligence was received
at Norwich that the Princess of Wales had, on the previous
evening, given birth to a son (Prince Albert Victor).&nbsp;
Throughout the day rejoicing peals were rung upon the bells of
St. Peter Mancroft, the Royal Standard was displayed at the
Guildhall, and on the 19th the Corporation sent a congratulatory
address to the Queen and to the Prince and Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Died at Norwich, Mr. George Fisher, a member of the
talented and well-known local family of that name, and of the
Norfolk and Suffolk Company of Comedians.&nbsp; On retiring from
the stage, he conducted a school at Swaffham, and subsequently
resided at Lynn, where he was for many years known as an
enthusiastic votary of the violin, and a useful member of the
band of the Musical Union.&nbsp; He was author of a curious and
voluminous work, entitled, &ldquo;A Companion and Key to the
History of England,&rdquo; printed by Skill, of Swaffham, and
published in 1832.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died at Hove, Brighton, Captain J. J. B. E. Frere,
R.N.&nbsp; He entered the Navy in 1826, and had been for nearly
twenty-five years engaged on active service&mdash;against the
pirates in the Mediterranean, in the operations on the coast of
Syria, in the Pacific with Lord George Paulet, and as
commissioner for the Government of the Sandwich Islands, while
held temporarily under the British flag.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The hearing of the action, Cox <i>v.</i> Wise,
arising out of the inundation in Marshland, was resumed in the
Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, and, after three days&rsquo;
argument for the rule in support of the verdict, and against the
rule to set it aside, the case was closed.&nbsp; Their lordships
reserved judgment until May 24th, when Mr. Justice Mellor held
that the Middle Level Commissioners were trustees for public
purposes, acting without reward and deriving no tolls from the
works; they had not the means of raising funds except for the
specific performance of the objects of their private Act.&nbsp;
He was of opinion that they were not liable for damages, and that
the rule must be made absolute.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Blackburn was
of the contrary opinion; he thought the plaintiff had a right to
his verdict, and that the rule should be discharged.&nbsp; Lord
Chief Justice Cockburn thought the defendants were not liable,
and said that the rule must be made absolute.&nbsp; Rule absolute
accordingly.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> June 9th, 1865.)</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;Died, aged 91, Mr. John Bennett, for many years
resident in Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deceased wore a pigtail to
the day of his death and was the last of the old school in the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.&mdash;It was announced that an attempt was being made to
form a religious order or brotherhood in Norwich, and that a
house on Elm Hill, formerly occupied by Mr. Elisha De Hague, had
been purchased for conversion into a monastery.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards a party of five brethren, headed by &ldquo;the
notorious Brother Ignatius,&rdquo; took up their quarters in the
newly-acquired premises, and, it was asserted, had the
countenance, if not the active support, of advanced High
Churchmen in the city, under whose auspices at this date lectures
were delivered &ldquo;in defence of Church principles,&rdquo; one
of the lecturers being the Rev. <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Dr. A. F. Littledale.&nbsp; On
February 24th, the &ldquo;Benedictine chapel,&rdquo; known as the
&ldquo;priory of St. Mary and Dunstan,&rdquo; was dedicated by
Ignatius.&nbsp; From this date scenes of disorder and riot were
of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of the monastery, and
directly and indirectly the existence of the confraternity gave
rise to several remarkable incidents.&nbsp; During Easter week
the &ldquo;monks&rdquo; made daily visits to St. Lawrence&rsquo;
church, which had already been brought into notoriety by the
ritualistic practices of the rector, the Rev. E. A.
Hillyard.&nbsp; There daily Communion was celebrated, and the
brethren walking in procession to and from the church were
assailed and insulted by the mob.&nbsp; The protection of the
police was demanded by Ignatius, and the magistrates were
frequently engaged in the hearing of cases of riot and assault
arising out of the proceedings at Elm Hill and St.
Lawrence&rsquo;.&nbsp; A spirit of unrest manifested itself in
other directions.&nbsp; On April 6th a person calling himself the
Baron De Camin, who stated that he was an ex-priest of the Romish
Church, delivered, at the Victoria Hall, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, a
lecture full of scurrilous and indecent observations.&nbsp; A
scene of great tumult ensued; the gas was extinguished, and,
under cover of darkness, the &ldquo;baron&rdquo; escaped.&nbsp;
Another lecturer appeared on the 14th and 15th, in the person of
Signor (formerly Father) Allessandro Gavazzi, who delivered
orations at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, on &ldquo;Romish
Encroachments at Home&rdquo; and &ldquo;Garibaldi and
Italy&rsquo;s Impending Future.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst the High
Church party were taking an aggressive stand in the city, a
section of the Low Church party in the county, led by the Rev. W.
Haslam, of Buckenham, were seeking, under the name of
&ldquo;Revivalism,&rdquo; to introduce Nonconformist methods into
the services of the Church.&nbsp; Meanwhile official notice was
taken of Mr. Hillyard&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp; At a meeting of
the Board of Guardians, on April 28th, it was agreed, &ldquo;That
the Rev. E. A. Hillyard having identified himself with certain
persons calling themselves monks, whom he has allowed to
participate in the services of his church, no longer holds the
confidence of the Board, and is called upon to resign his
situation as chaplain of the Norwich Workhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Hillyard declined to vacate the office, and a deputation of the
Board waited upon the Bishop, who expressed strong disapproval of
the reverend gentleman&rsquo;s action.&nbsp; A meeting of the
parishioners of St. Lawrence&rsquo; passed a resolution on May
6th: &ldquo;That this vestry views with grief and indignation the
manner in which Divine worship has been performed of late,
particularly as regards the dressing of the Communion table, and
the minister allowing persons calling themselves monks to take a
prominent part in the performance of the services.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The resolution was numerously signed by the parishioners and
presented to the Bishop.&nbsp; St. Gregory&rsquo;s church, during
the incumbency of the Rev. W. B. Sharpe, became a centre of
ritualism, and on June 9th advantage was taken, on the
appointment of the new incumbent, the Rev. J. Wortley, to
petition the Archdeacon of Norwich to sanction the removal of
&ldquo;a floral cross and other floral decorations from the
chancel and the candlesticks from the Communion table, of
monograms and emblems recently painted on the chancel steps, and
of the curtains and drapery from the walls of the chancel, and to
order the restoration of the Commandments, the Belief, and the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in their place&rdquo;; and the minister was
requested &ldquo;to discontinue the weekly offering, as it was
strongly objected to by many of the parishioners.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
August 23rd Mr. Wortley announced that many of the objectionable
ornaments had <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>been removed; and on August 27th it was stated that the
English Church Union had resolved to raise a special fund to meet
expenses that might be incurred by Mr. Smith, churchwarden, in
legally protesting against the action which had led to their
removal.&nbsp; On June 27th a meeting of the supporters of the
district schools of the associated parishes of St. Peter
Mancroft, St. John Maddermarket, St. Gregory, St. Lawrence, and
St. Margaret, resolved &ldquo;That the Rev. E. A. Hillyard had
entirely forfeited the confidence of the committee, by mixing
himself up with certain persons calling themselves monks, and Mr.
Henry Browne finding it impossible, under the circumstances, to
collect subscriptions, had therefore refused to continue to act
with Mr. Hillyard, either as treasurer, secretary, or
manager.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hillyard upon this decision severed his
connection with the association, but refused to accede to a
request, signed by some of the leading clergy in Norwich and
Norfolk, on July 2nd, to discontinue his practices at St.
Lawrence&rsquo; or to comply with the wishes of the Bishop.&nbsp;
On August 17th the Guardians passed a resolution prohibiting his
further attendance at the Workhouse; and on October 25th Sir John
Walsham, the Poor-Law Inspector for the district, held an inquiry
at the Guildhall into his conduct.&nbsp; The Poor-Law Board, on
December 14th, intimated to the Guardians that they had dismissed
Mr. Hillyard from the chaplaincy.&nbsp; The Elm Hill monastery
was closed in May, 1866, and the building work of a proposed new
chapel to be erected by Ignatius suspended.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>
January 16th, 1869.)</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died at Sidcup, Kent, in his 96th year, Mr. Edward
Smyth, formerly agent in Norwich of the Bank of England.&nbsp;
His early career was spent in the Army.&nbsp; He served at the
fall of Seringapatam, in 1799, with the 25th Light Dragoons, who,
at Mullavelly, routed the cavalry of Tippoo Sahib, thereby
enabling Lord Harris to bring to a successful termination his
siege operations against that important fortress.&nbsp; Mr. Smith
afterwards served with the Duke of Wellington in that Indian
campaign which ended with the famous battles of Assaye and
Urgam.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;The agitation for the repeal of the Malt Tax was
re-opened with increased vigour at a large meeting of West
Norfolk farmers, held at the Town Hall, Lynn, under the
presidency of the High Sheriff (Mr. H. Lee Warner).&nbsp; A
resolution was passed affirming that the tax was unjust in
principle, utterly opposed to the Free Trade policy adopted on
the repeal of the Corn Laws, and most injurious to British
farmers as producers of barley.&nbsp; Members of Parliament were
urged to support its repeal.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Sir Henry Stracey announced to the electors of
Yarmouth his intention of retiring from the representation of the
borough.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The Mayor of Yarmouth (Mr. R. Steward), who, for the
fourth time, had held that office, was presented with a piece of
plate, valued at 200 gs., in appreciation of his public services
and his private worth.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The church of St. John Maddermarket, Norwich, was
re-opened <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

restoration had been carried out, under the direction of Messrs.
Elmslie, Franey, and Haddon, of London, at the cost of
&pound;1,431.</p>
<p>9.*&mdash;&ldquo;Col. Black, Chief Constable of the county,

Norwich, Mr. David Hodgson, artist.&nbsp; He was the son of Mr.
Charles Hodgson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The names of both father and son
are connected with the list of local celebrities in Art, in which
may be included the names of Crome, Vincent, Stark, and Joseph
Stannard.&rdquo;&nbsp; David Hodgson excelled in architectural
subjects, which he painted with great care and truthfulness of
detail.</p>

Coke, eldest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Leicester, was
solemnised at St. George&rsquo;s church, Hanover Square.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The first meeting of the Norwich Geological Society
was held under the presidency of the Rev. J. Gunn, F.G.S.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The Bill for the projected East Norfolk Railway was
considered before a Committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; It
was strongly opposed by the Yarmouth Haven and Pier
Commissioners, and by the North Walsham and Dilham Canal
Commissioners, as offering unfair competition with water
communication in that part of the county.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

for many years resident in Norwich.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died at his residence, Tombland, Norwich, Mr. Roger
Kerrison, aged 61.&nbsp; He had for some time been in ill-health,
and five weeks before his death, while superintending the cutting
down of some timber, sustained a fall and received a severe
shock.&nbsp; Mr. Kerrison was, in many respects, a remarkable
personage.&nbsp; He was the son of Mr. Allday Kerrison, and was
educated for the law, a profession he continued to practise until
his decease, although a large accession of fortune on the death
of his uncle, Mr. Matthew Kerrison, of Ranworth, twenty years
previously, had placed him in independent circumstances.&nbsp;
Mr. Kerrison held several important public appointments, but he
was more widely known by reason of his connection with the
Norwich Triennial Musical Festival, of which he was for some
years the active honorary secretary.&nbsp; In politics he was
Conservative, but by no means a prejudiced partisan, and he never
scrupled to act independently when he deemed it right to do
so.&nbsp; He was a bachelor, and the bulk of his fortune went to
his brother, Mr. Allday Kerrison, a partner in the Crown Bank,
Norwich.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;Died, in his 78th year, Mr. William Johnson Fox, for
many years member of Parliament for Oldham, and popularly known
as &ldquo;the Norwich Weaver Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The 18th Hussars left Norwich for Shorncliffe, prior
to their embarkation for India.&nbsp; This was the first regiment
which departed from the city by train.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The annual show of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association was held at Lynn, and was visited by upwards of
14,000 persons.&nbsp; Mr. R. J. H. Harvey was president for the
year.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died, near Christchurch, New Zealand, aged 59, the
Ven. Octavius Mathias, Archdeacon of Akaron and formerly vicar of
Horsford.&nbsp; He was one of the first to take an interest in
the foundation of Canterbury Cathedral, New Zealand, and was
elected one of the capitular clergy.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A barque, named the Oriental, was launched from Mr.
J. W. Rust&rsquo;s shipyard at Yarmouth.&nbsp; The vessel, which
was intended for the China trade, was 115 feet long, 24 feet
beam, 15 ft. 8 inches in depth, and 320 tons burthen.</p>
<p>9.*&mdash;&ldquo;An agreement has been entered into for the
purchase, by the Provincial Banking Corporation, of the business
of the East of England Bank, an unlimited joint stock bank
established in 1836, with head office at Norwich and branches at
Yarmouth, Lynn, North Walsham, Fakenham, East Dereham, Swaffham,
Bungay, Halesworth, and Harleston, and agencies at Wymondham,
Wells, and Hingham.&rdquo;&nbsp; The city <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>was
startled on the 20th by the rumour that the Bank had suspended
payment.&nbsp; &ldquo;On those who had accounts at the Bank going
to that establishment, the doors were found to be closed, and a
printed notice was exhibited in the windows to the effect that
the directors regretted to intimate that they were compelled to
suspend business.&nbsp; Up to the hour of closing on the previous
day the directors, after having resolved to suspend payment,
continued to receive the money of unsuspecting
customers.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days afterwards was issued a
statement, from which it appeared that the Bank&rsquo;s
liabilities were &pound;576,963 7s. 6d., and assets
&pound;453,256 5s. 3d., leaving a deficit of &pound;123,707 2s.
3d.&nbsp; Meetings of the shareholders were held, at which
resolutions were passed in favour of registering the company
under the Companies Act, 1862, with the view to a voluntary
winding up.&nbsp; On August 13th it was announced that the
Provincial Banking Company had issued a circular to the late
customers of the Bank, stating &ldquo;that being satisfied there
was a probability of the customers being paid in full, they had
authorised the branch managers at once to give credit to each
customer of the East of England Bank in his pass-book for the
full amount of the balance due to him on his current account with
the East of England Bank.&rdquo;&nbsp; Messrs. Harveys and
Hudsons, immediately after the issue of the circular, offered
like terms.&nbsp; Dividends were, in due course, paid to the
creditors of the Bank.&nbsp; In July, 1866, it was stated that
the liquidators had announced &ldquo;a further dividend of 2s.
6d. in the pound, which will make 20s. in the pound distributed,
exclusive of interest, payment of which is postponed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Died at the Palace Hotel, Buckingham Gate, London,
Admiral Bertie Cornelius Cator, younger brother of Mr. John
Cator, of Beckenham, Kent, and of Woodbastwick.&nbsp; He entered
the Navy in 1800, under his uncle, Captain Albemarle Bertie, and
was actively employed early in his professional career in the
capture of privateers in the Mediterranean.&nbsp; In 1810 he
assisted at the taking of the Isle of France; commanded the
Act&aelig;on on the coast of America in the attack on the
enemy&rsquo;s barracks in Lynn Haven Bay in 1813, and
participated in various other services.&nbsp; After gaining post
rank, he was not employed afloat.&nbsp; He accepted retirement in
1846.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;Merton Park was the scene of great rejoicing, on the
coming of age of the Hon. Thomas de Grey.&nbsp; Seven hundred
cottagers and labourers were entertained at dinner, and Lord and
Lady Walsingham received a large number of personal friends in a
pavilion erected near the famous Merton oak.&nbsp; At luncheon
Lord Ashburton proposed the health of Mr. de Grey, which was
drunk with great enthusiasm.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s festivities
concluded with a display of fireworks.&nbsp; On the 30th Lord and
Lady Walsingham gave a ball to 150 tenants on the Merton estate,
and on the 31st the celebration ended with a servants&rsquo;
ball.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>26.&mdash;Two troops of the 16th Lancers arrived at Norwich
Barracks.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;St. George&rsquo;s Brewery, Norwich, and 40
public-houses were offered for sale by Messrs. Spelman.&nbsp;
Messrs. Youngs, Crawshay, and Youngs were the purchasers, at the
sum of &pound;15,300.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;Died at Norwich, aged 81, Henry Drane, for
thirty-six years proprietor of the Telegraph coach.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A prize-fight for &pound;5 took place near Lynn,
between Pooley Mace and Grey.&nbsp; Mace was declared the victor,
after a contest which lasted 35 minutes.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;The Yarmouth Town Council, by a majority of 25 to 11,
adopted the Public House Closing Act, 1864.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The first sod of the West Norfolk Junction Railway
was turned by Miss Ellen Simpson, daughter of Mr. Lightly
Simpson, the chairman of the company.&nbsp; Many persons
travelled to Heacham to take part in the proceedings.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> January 8th, 1866.)</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Died, Captain Becher, &ldquo;the well-known
sportsman and father of steeplechase riders, whose deeds in the
pigskin some 30 years back have immortalised him in the annals of
that sport.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Becher was born in Norfolk, and
was the son of a farmer, &ldquo;who was very conspicuous as a
horseman and the last of the leather breeches school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>16.&mdash;A new screw steamer, the Ontario, 3,200 tons,
Captain Brooklin, upon her first voyage, from Shields to
Alexandria, laden with coals and iron, struck upon Happisburgh
Sand.&nbsp; Three steam tugs and the Caister lifeboat proceeded
to her assistance, and her cargo was thrown overboard, but every
effort made to get her off proved unavailing.&nbsp; On the 17th
the weather became very threatening, and the lifeboat took off 56
coal heavers, but the captain and officers and 86 of the crew
determined to remain with the vessel.&nbsp; During the night the
storm increased, and the crew, apparently in great distress, sent
up rockets and burned blue lights.&nbsp; The Yarmouth lifeboatmen
were implored by the ship&rsquo;s agent, Mr. Butler, to go to the
ship, but in vain.&nbsp; They refused to launch the lifeboat
unless they were paid from &pound;400 to &pound;500, saying that
the steam tugs had begun the work and had better finish it.&nbsp;
The Caister lifeboat stood by the vessel, which, by the 20th, had
so settled down that it was hopeless to attempt to get her
off.&nbsp; On this day 68 of the crew left in a lifeboat
belonging to the steamer, but the captain and officers declined
to desert her.&nbsp; They were, however, compelled to leave on
the 22nd, when she became a total wreck, and was offered for
sale.&nbsp; The original value of the Ontario was
&pound;120,000.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The church of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth, was opened
after restoration, at the cost of about &pound;6,000.&nbsp; The
sermon was preached by the Bishop of Oxford, and at the luncheon
held subsequently, under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. R.
Steward), the company included the Bishops of Norwich and Oxford,
the Bishop of British Columbia, Lord Sondes (High Steward of the
borough), and many other distinguished guests.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Charles Edward Tuck was elected Mayor, and Mr.
Charles Jecks appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>9.&mdash;Died at Keswick, near Norwich, in his 90th
year, Mr. Hudson Gurney.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Mr.
Richard Gurney, who died at Keswick in 1811.&nbsp; Educated by
Dr. Thomas Young, of scientific celebrity, he became connected
early in life with the great banking firm of the Gurneys, of
which he was for many years senior partner, as well as with the
noted London brewery of Barclay and Co., his mother being the
daughter and heiress of Mr. David Barclay, of Youngbury,
Herts.&nbsp; In 1809 he married Margaret, daughter of Robert
Barclay, of Ury, descended from the celebrated Barclay, the
Apologist for the Quakers.&nbsp; Mrs. Gurney died at Keswick on
December 16th, 1855.&nbsp; In politics Mr. Gurney was, in many
respects, decidedly Conservative, though on some points he held
opinions more in accordance with the most advanced Liberalism,
and, as a perfectly independent member, allied himself to no
party in particular.&nbsp; His Parliamentary career commenced in
1812, when he was elected for Shaftesbury; from the year 1816 he
represented Newport, Hants., in six successive Parliaments.&nbsp;
In 1835 he served the office of High Sheriff for the county of
Norfolk.&nbsp; He was a man of high literary attainments, and was
vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries, a Fellow of the
Royal and Linn&aelig;an Societies, vice-president of the Norwich
Museum, the Literary Institute, and of the Norfolk and Norwich
Arch&aelig;ological Society.&nbsp; As an author his chief
production was probably the beautiful poem in English verse under
the title of &ldquo;Cupid and Psyche,&rdquo; a mythological tale
from the &ldquo;Golden Ass&rdquo; of Apuleius; in 1801 it had
reached a third edition, and was afterwards reprinted in Mr.
Davenport&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poetical Register.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also
published, for private distribution, in 1843, a translation into
English verse of the &ldquo;Orlando Furioso&rdquo; of Ludovico
Ariosto; and in 1847, in a letter to Mr. Dawson Turner,
&ldquo;Proofs that Norwich, and not Caistor, was the Venta
Icenorum.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his latter years, confined almost
entirely to his own residence, &ldquo;he reversed in his hours
the usual custom, amusing himself with his books and writings
till four or five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, of course,
rising comparatively late in the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; His estate,
real and personal included, was valued at &pound;1,200,000.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Lynn Town Council resolved to put an end to the
absurd and obnoxious impost known as &ldquo;the Lady
Mayoresses&rsquo; Pin Money.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For many years
the custom has prevailed in the town of the constables (who
perform no other duties) going round to all the inhabitants in
October and November and collecting from all who were foolish
enough to pay it a kind of blackmail, under the ridiculous title
of the Lady Mayoresses&rsquo; Pin Money, pretending that it was
legally payable under the charters, and that those who did not
pay would be summoned before the magistrates or the County
Court.&nbsp; It appears that the custom has grown out of the
collection of fines for non-attendance at the Court Leet held
annually by the Mayor as Lord of the Manor; but for many
generations past no such attendance has been either any use or
capable of enforcement.&nbsp; The fines have also completely
lapsed, and those who collect the &lsquo;pin money&rsquo; are
completely ignorant of its origin.&nbsp; The pretence has been
that the money was to buy a piece of plate for the Mayoress, but
in reality the greater part of it has been appropriated by the
collectors themselves, and of the many pounds obtained not more
than some fifty shillings annually found its way into the borough
fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12.*&mdash;&ldquo;There appears to be some probability that
the absurd <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>system of inspection of weights and measures at Lynn by
a &lsquo;jury of headboroughs&rsquo; going round the town in a
posse and discharging their functions in such a manner that the
innocent only are punished and the guilty easily escape
detection, is about to come to an end.&nbsp; Several persons have
refused to admit the headboroughs on their premises, and others
have declined to pay the fines imposed on them by the
&lsquo;jury&rsquo;; and as the authority of this jury is based on
ancient charters of very doubtful legal force, and there is no
prospect of that authority being respected or enforced, the jury
have refused to be sworn in again on the Court Leet by which they
are appointed.&nbsp; It may be hoped, therefore, that the farce
has come to an end, and that very shortly a proper and efficient
officer will be appointed under the provisions of the Weights and
Measures Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The newly-erected chancel of St. Mark&rsquo;s
church, Lakenham, Norwich, built at the cost of about
&pound;1,000, was consecrated by the Bishop of Norwich.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A severe gale occurred off the Norfolk coast.&nbsp;
Many shipping casualties were reported.&nbsp; The screw steamer
William Hutt, 530 tons, employed as a transport during the
Crimean War, was lost off Yarmouth with her crew of sixteen
hands, whilst on a voyage from Sunderland to London, with
coals.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>17.*&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Thomas W. Rutland, carpenter, West Wymer
Street, Norwich, has invented a very ingenious means of
communication between the passengers and guard in a railway
train.&nbsp; It has the additional advantage of acting also as an
extra break when required.&nbsp; By its use a passenger can at
once communicate with both guard and driver, and at the same time
a signal is exhibited which shows from what carriage the alarm is
given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a
communication was received from the Dean and Chapter as to the
giving up of their interest in Mousehold Heath, with the view of
enabling the Council to convert the Heath into a people&rsquo;s
park.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Christmas &ldquo;burlesque and comic
pantomime&rdquo; produced at Norwich Theatre was written by F. C.
Burnand, and entitled, &ldquo;Snowdrop, King Bonbon, and the
Seven Elves, or the Magic Mirror and the Fatal Sewing
Machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Sanger&rsquo;s Circus, on the Castle
Meadow, was produced &ldquo;the equestrian pantomime,&rdquo;
entitled, &ldquo;Jack the Giant Killer, or Harlequin and the
Fairies of the Crystal Fountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; A great novelty at
the Christmas Fair was &ldquo;the striking feature of a
roundabout worked by a steam engine, which at the same time turns
a barrel organ.&rdquo;</p>

months.</p>

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at Holkham
Park, on a visit to the Earl and Countess of Leicester.&nbsp; On
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th his Royal Highness shot over the estate,
and on the latter date 2,000 head of game was killed.&nbsp; On
the night of the 5th a distinguished company were invited to a
ball, given by the Earl and Countess; and on the morning of the
6th the Prince and his noble host engaged in wildfowl
shooting.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses returned to Sandringham
the same afternoon.</p>
<p>7.*&mdash;&ldquo;Amongst the recent improvements in Norwich
there are none to bear comparison with the magnificent bank of
Messrs. Harveys and Hudson, which is now approaching completion
by Messrs. Lucas, nor will there be one which has been erected at
so small a comparative cost.&nbsp; The contract for the new bank,
of which Mr. P. Hardwicke is the architect, does not exceed
&pound;13,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bank was opened for business on
January 1st, 1866.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The Prince of Wales visited Lord Walsingham, at
Merton Hall, and attended a meet of the West Norfolk Hunt.&nbsp;
On the 14th, after a day&rsquo;s cover shooting, has Royal
Highness returned to Sandringham, accompanied by the Hon. T. de
Grey.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;The agitation against the Malt Tax was re-opened
this year at Lynn, when a great meeting, convened by the West
Norfolk Anti-Malt Tax Association, was held at the Town Hall,
under the presidency of the High Sheriff (Mr. H. Lee
Warner).&nbsp; On February 4th, at a preliminary meeting held at
the Swan Hotel, Norwich, presided over by Mr. Clare Sewell Read,
the farmers of East Norfolk formed a similar association, and at
a public meeting which took place on February 18th, Sir Henry
Stracey was elected president, Mr. Robert Gillett treasurer, and
Mr. G. H. Murrell secretary.&nbsp; Many petitions were signed in
the district in favour of the repeal of the tax.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;A meeting of the inhabitants was held at the Corn
Hall, Yarmouth, &ldquo;to take into consideration the provisions
of the Haven and Port Bill, and to determine whether the scheme
should be supported or opposed in Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
Bill was intended to supersede the functions of the Haven
Commissioners and to protect the shipowners and fishermen, but
great opposition was raised against it by the class in whose
interests it was avowedly framed.&nbsp; The Norwich Town Council,
at a meeting on March 21st, decided to oppose the measure.&nbsp;
A Committee of the House of Commons, by whom the Bill was
considered, on March 30th unanimously resolved that, &ldquo;in
the absence of unanimity of feeling among the parties affected,
including the town of Yarmouth itself, it is not expedient to
pass the preamble of the Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, therefore,
thrown out.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 30th, 1866.)</p>

<p>6.&mdash;The respective merits of the new iron ploughs
introduced by Messrs. Ransomes and Sims, of Ipswich, and of the
common Norfolk plough, were tested on Messrs. Salter&rsquo;s farm
at Attleborough.&nbsp; &ldquo;In their lightness and symmetry the
former presented a strong contrast.&nbsp; The Norfolk plough drew
nearly half as heavy again as the iron ploughs, or in the
proportion of 3 to 2 in the shallow work, and in the deep work
one quarter heavier, or in the proportion of 4 to 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;A remarkable incident occurred at Lakenham
church.&nbsp; A wedding had been arranged, and the Rev. C.
Baldwin, of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Norwich, had promised, with the
approbation of the vicar, the Rev. A. Pownall, to
officiate.&nbsp; When the wedding party arrived at Lakenham, they
found the church closed.&nbsp; An entrance was effected, but the
vestry was locked, and neither surplice nor books were provided
for the clergyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was suggested that a sheet
should be borrowed, and the Rev. Mr. Baldwin, habited in this
novel vestment, proceeded to unite the parties in the bonds of
matrimony, and after having sent to the clergyman&rsquo;s house
for the parish registers, the happy couple were at length enabled
to proceed on their wedding trip.&nbsp; Mr. Pownall, who was
himself the cause of the whole difficulty, having forgotten to
inform the clerk of the forthcoming ceremony, issued the
following extraordinary handbill:&mdash;&lsquo;Lakenham
church.&nbsp; A solemn service will be held on Friday, the 24th
inst., to avert the wrath of Almighty God and to deprecate His
righteous judgments in consequence of the profanation of His
sanctuary on Monday last . . .&nbsp; Ezekiel v.,
11.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The incident gave rise to much
comment.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;A great fire occurred at Frazer&rsquo;s sawmills,
near St. Martin-at-Palace church, Norwich, and resulted in the
loss of about &pound;4,000 worth of property.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died at North Walsham, Mary Doughty, aged 101
years.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn, was tried a remarkable action for assault, false
imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.&nbsp; The plaintiff, Mr.
Albert Pell (son of Sir Albert Pell, of Northamptonshire), with
his brother, while on a visit to Yarmouth, crossed the fields of
the defendant, Mr. Mayes Wigg, at Caister.&nbsp; They had with
them a Skye terrier, and defendant, alleging that they were
poaching, gave them into the custody of a policeman, who, after
detaining them at his cottage, took them before a magistrate at
Thrigby.&nbsp; The charge was dismissed, whereupon the present
action was commenced.&nbsp; The jury found for the plaintiff on
the first count, charging assault and false imprisonment, and
awarded damages &pound;5; and for defendant on the second count,
charging malicious prosecution.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;Died at Yarmouth, Mr. George Danby Palmer, aged
77.&nbsp; In early life Mr. Palmer was an active supporter of the
Tory party, but previous to the passing of the Reform Bill he
adopted Liberal principles, and after the introduction of the
Municipal Reform Act became decidedly Radical.&nbsp; He was the
oldest member of the borough Bench, <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>and a justice of the peace for the
county.&nbsp; &ldquo;Possessed of large property, he lavished his
wealth with unsparing hand upon those whom he deemed worthy of
his assistance, but as it was rendered so unobtrusively, with the
exception of the recipients of his bounty, the world was not
aware of his generosity.&nbsp; He was a straightforward
Englishman, and was greatly lamented by all classes in
Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The English Grand Opera Company, under the
management of Mr. G. B. Loveday, commenced an engagement at
Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; Madame Haigh-Dyer, Miss Annie Kemp, Miss
Ada Taylor, Mr. Brookhouse Bowler, Mr. Grantham, Mr. E. Connell,
Mr. Oliver Summers, and Mr. Henry Rowland were the principal
<i>artistes</i>, and the works produced included
&ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dinorah,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Crown
Diamonds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lady
of Lyons&rdquo; (burlesque), &ldquo;Satanella,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Norma.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>17.&mdash;The Snettisham Hall estate of 2,600 acres and a
rental of &pound;3,600 was offered for sale at
Garraway&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The highest bid was &pound;99,000, and
the reserve was declared at &pound;130,000.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, the action, le
Strange <i>v.</i> Rowe, which raised an important question as to
sea-shore rights, came on for hearing.&nbsp; The defendant was
proceeded against for taking shingle, sand, and shell-fish from
the sea shore in the manor of Snettisham, belonging to the
plaintiff.&nbsp; About twenty special pleas were set up by the
defendant and demurred to in point of law, on the broad ground
that there could not be in law any such rights as alleged,
&ldquo;either in all the subjects of the realm or by Royal grant
or by custom or by prescription in inhabitants or
occupiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Court deferred judgment, and
ultimately referred the case to the Norfolk Assizes for decision
as to questions of fact.&nbsp; At Norwich, on August 4th, the
case was adjourned to enable the plaintiff to amend the
declarations.&nbsp; The case came before Lord Chief Justice Erle
at the Norfolk Assizes on August 13th, 1866, when the jury
returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages one shilling.&nbsp;
In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, on May 28th, 1867,
application was made for a new trial, on the ground of
misdirection and that the verdict was given for the plaintiff
against the weight of evidence.&nbsp; The application was
refused.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;An earthquake shock was distinctly felt along the
coast from Scratby, on the north of Yarmouth, to Lowestoft, on
the south.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s birthday was observed as a general
holiday at Norwich.&nbsp; A detachment of the 16th Lancers and
the Volunteers were reviewed in Chapel Field, and fired a <i>feu
de joie</i> in the Market Place; the Mayor gave a luncheon at the
Guildhall, and the Volunteers were entertained at the Corn
Hall.&nbsp; The Mayor&rsquo;s ball took place in the evening, at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Considerable opposition was manifested, not only by
the villagers, but by the citizens of Norwich, to an attempt made
by Capt. Bellairs to enclose Mulbarton Common.&nbsp; A meeting
was held in the village, at which a strong protest was made
against the proposal, and it was asserted that if ever the
ancestors of Capt. Bellairs had possessed the power to effect the
enclosure, they had allowed their rights to lapse.</p>

Light Horse Volunteers.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Mr. A. Dennison, brother of the Speaker of the House
of Commons, visited Norwich, for the purpose of hearing the bells
of St. Peter Mancroft.&nbsp; &ldquo;He rang the tenor in good
style, and was highly delighted with the quality of tone of this
far-famed peal of twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;In the Court of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, application
was made in the action, the Queen <i>v.</i> the Middle Level
Commissioners, for a rule calling upon them to show cause why a
mandamus should not issue commanding them to make and maintain a
bridge with a commodious road or hailing path in the place
formerly occupied by their sluice which was destroyed in the
great inundation in 1862.&nbsp; A rule was granted.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> January 7th, 1867.)</p>
<p>13.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a
report was received from Mr. Bazalgette, C.E., who had visited
Norwich with the view of determining what steps could be taken
for the immediate purification of the river Wensum in the
vicinity of the city.&nbsp; He stated that it would be impossible
to render the river pure so long as it continued to be a
receptacle for the town refuse; and he had examined the city and
suburbs to ascertain how to improve the drainage and to dispose
of the sewage.&nbsp; The time would come, he added, when a
drainage scheme would be urgently necessary, and very
costly.&nbsp; The Council authorised the Sanitary and River
Committees to expend a sum not exceeding &pound;50 in obtaining
levels and plans and other information required by Mr.
Bazalgette, &ldquo;to assist him in the preparation of his scheme
for diverting the drainage from the river.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
October 17th Mr. Bazalgette&rsquo;s scheme was laid before the
Council.&nbsp; It provided for two intercepting sewers, one for
the higher and the other for the lower parts of the city, both
forming a junction on the opposite side of the river near Trowse
Station, whence the sewage would be conveyed to a point on Mr.
Harvey&rsquo;s estate at Crown Point, to the east of the old
Whitlingham Road.&nbsp; The plan also comprised the completion of
the drainage of the western part of the city, then unconnected
with the main sewers.&nbsp; For the first part of the scheme
&pound;50,000 was required, and for the latter
&pound;30,000.&nbsp; On October 31st the Council adopted a
recommendation of the Sanitary and River Committees, that it was
desirable to try more fully the possibility of cleansing the
river by flushing and sluicing or otherwise before proceeding to
carry out Mr. Bazalgette&rsquo;s report; that the City Engineer
be instructed accordingly; and that immediate steps be taken to
improve the drainage on the south side of the city, at a cost not
exceeding &pound;10,000.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 21st, 1866.)</p>

class="pagenum">p. 145</span>George Augustus Henry, first Earl of
Burlington.&nbsp; Lord Charles was at the battle of Corunna, and
served in the Walcheren Expedition with the Guards.&nbsp; In 1811
he joined Lord Hill&rsquo;s staff, and was present at the siege
and capture of Badajoz, and at the battles of Vittoria, Pyrenees,
Nivelle, Nive, Othes, Toulouse, and Waterloo, and received the
war medal with eight clasps.&nbsp; For two years he served with
the army of occupation in France.&nbsp; His lordship sat in
Parliament, as member for Thetford, from 1818 till the passing of
the Reform Bill, and at the General Election which ensued was
elected for Bury, in the Liberal interest.&nbsp; He was
Vice-Chancellor of the Household from 1835 to 1839, and was also
appointed a Privy Councillor.&nbsp; In four successive
Parliaments he represented Bury, and resigned his seat in
1847.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The 5.30 p.m. express from London to Norwich had a
narrow escape.&nbsp; On reaching a portion of the line near
Harford Bridges, the engine, on running down the incline, left
the metals, and, tearing up the permanent way for some distance,
stopped on the wooden bridge which crosses the Yare a little
below Old Lakenham.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the carriages was
overturned, and the occupants, among whom was Lord Stafford, had
to make their escape by climbing through the windows which were
then uppermost.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of the passengers were
seriously hurt.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;At a Liberal meeting held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
Norwich, certain accusations founded upon letters received from
Mr. John Bright, M.P., were made against Mr. Robert Edmond
Chester Waters, one of the Conservative candidates for the
representation of the city.&nbsp; The principal charges were that
Mr. Waters (previously a Liberal) had been compelled to resign
his membership of the Reform Club for cheating at cards, and that
while he came before the Norwich electors as a Protestant
Churchman, in Rome he professed to be a Roman Catholic.&nbsp; Mr.
Waters declared these statements to be scandalous and false; and
on the 8th announced that he had authorised legal proceedings to
be taken against Sir William Foster and the Rev. George Gould for
making imputations on his personal character.&nbsp; On the 10th a
deputation, consisting of Messrs. H. S. Patteson, Edward Field,
D. Dalrymple, and J. H. Tillett, proceeded to London to
investigate at the Reform Club the truth of the allegations, and
in the course of the day the following telegram was received
simultaneously by Sir Samuel Bignold and Sir William Foster:
&ldquo;We have the minutes.&nbsp; They have been produced before
us, and we find that it is true that Mr. Waters was accused of
cheating at cards at the Reform Club, and unanimously called upon
by the committee to resign to prevent expulsion, and further that
he did, on receiving that communication, resign on the 23rd
November, 1860.&rdquo;&nbsp; The telegram was dated from the
Reform Club, and signed by the deputation.&nbsp; In consequence
of the telegram, Messrs. Fred Brown, J. B. Morgan, F. E. Watson,
and Henry Ling issued a notice stating that they felt it their
duty to withdraw their support from Mr. Waters as one of the
candidates for the city.&nbsp; Mr. Waters thereupon stated that
he would stand independently.&nbsp; The nomination took place at
the Guildhall on the 11th.&nbsp; The other candidates were Sir
William <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>Russell and Mr. Edward Warner, Liberals; and Mr.
Augustus Goldsmid, Conservative.&nbsp; The polling took place on
the 12th, and was officially declared on the 13th, as
follows:&mdash;Russell, 1,845; Warner, 1,838; Goldsmid, 1,466;
Waters, 1,363.&nbsp; Mr. Waters, who was exceedingly popular with
what the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> described
as &ldquo;the lower order of Conservatives,&rdquo; made a return
visit to Norwich on October 10th, and was escorted by a
torchlight procession round the city.&nbsp; Thirty thousand
people assembled in the Market Place, the bells of St. Peter
Mancroft were rung, and the late candidate, after making a
complimentary call upon Sir Samuel Bignold, proceeded to the
Norfolk Hotel and addressed from the window a dense crowd
assembled in St. Giles&rsquo; Street.&nbsp; On the 11th he was
entertained at dinner by the Eldon Club; and at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, on the 12th, was received with the utmost
enthusiasm by a crowded audience.&nbsp; Mr. Waters, who was
accompanied by Lord Henry Thynne and Sir Alfred Slade, was
presented with a massive silver epergne, &ldquo;by a very large
number of the Conservatives of Norwich, as an expression of their
cordial sympathy and regard, and in appreciation of the gallant
and chivalrous spirit in which, under difficulties unprecedented,
he fought the battle of the Conservative cause loyally,
courteously, and fearlessly at the Parliamentary election for
Norwich, 1865.&rdquo;&nbsp; A &ldquo;testimonial dinner&rdquo;
was given to Mr. Waters at the Norfolk Hotel on the evening of
the 13th, when the Norwich Conservative Association was
inaugurated.&nbsp; Upwards of 100 members were at once enrolled,
and on the 14th Sir Samuel Bignold, in response to the request of
a deputation, accepted the presidency.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;A meeting of the independent electors of East Norfolk
was held at the Swan Hotel, Norwich, for the purpose of selecting
a candidate to contest the constituency in the interests of the
supporters of the movement for the repeal of the Malt Tax.&nbsp;
Mr. Clare Sewell Read, who had been for some time prominently
identified with the party in favour of the repeal, was
unanimously chosen.&nbsp; Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett attended the
meeting and made a remarkable speech.&nbsp; If Mr. Read were
nominated, he said, he would help him to the utmost of his power;
and he added, &ldquo;If you want money, if you want help, if you
want what enthusiasm I can put into the cause, let your chairman
write to me and I will respond with all my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The nomination took place at the Shirehall on the 15th.&nbsp;
Several times the proceedings were stayed and consultations held
by the leaders of the respective parties, with the view of
effecting a compromise.&nbsp; The candidates nominated were Mr.
Edward Howes, Sir Thomas Beauchamp, and Col. Coke.&nbsp; Mr.
Robert Leamon offered not to proceed with the nomination of Mr.
Read if the Liberal party would pledge themselves to return to
Parliament a Malt Tax repealer; in the absence of that assurance
he nominated Mr. Read, whose candidature was seconded by Mr. H.
S. Grimmer.&nbsp; It was subsequently agreed by the friends of
Mr. Howes to permit the name of Mr. Read to appear upon the
election cards and posters issued by the former.&nbsp; The poll
was opened on the 18th, and was officially declared on the 20th,
as follows:&mdash;Howes, 3,100; Read, 2,985; Beauchamp, 2,150;
Coke, 1,994</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The nomination of candidates for the representation
of Yarmouth was held at the Town Hall.&nbsp; Sir E. H. K. Lacon,
Bart., and Mr. J. Goodson, Conservatives, and Mr. Philip
Vanderbyl and Mr. Brogden, liberals, were nominated.&nbsp; The
polling took place on the <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>12th, and resulted as
follows:&mdash;Lacon 828; Goodson, 784; Brogden, 634; Vanderbyl,
589.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 20th, 1866.)</p>
<p>11.&mdash;At Thetford, the Hon. Alexander Hugh Baring and Mr.
Robert John Harvey Harvey, Conservatives, and Mr. Thomas Dakin
(Alderman of London and Sheriff of Middlesex), Liberal, were
nominated to represent the borough.&nbsp; The poll, on the 12th,
resulted as follows:&mdash;Harvey, 193; Baring, 137; Dakin,
69.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Lord Stanley and the Hon. Frederick Walpole,
Conservatives, and Sir T. Fowell Buxton, Liberal, were nominated
for the representation of King&rsquo;s Lynn.&nbsp; The polling,
on the 13th, resulted in the return of Lord Stanley, 445 votes,
and Sir T. Fowell Buxton, 401 votes.&nbsp; Mr. Walpole polled 339
votes.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at Herne Bay, aged 43 years, Mr. Samuel Peckworth
Woodward, Ph.D., F.G.S., assistant in the Geological Department
of the British Museum, and second son of Mr. Samuel Woodward, of
Norwich.&nbsp; He was a member of several learned societies, and
in 1845 was appointed professor of botany and geology at the
Royal Agricultural College.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The nomination of candidates for West Norfolk took
place at Swaffham.&nbsp; The Conservatives were Mr. William Bagge
and the Hon. T. de Grey (the latter strongly opposed as &ldquo;an
excessive game preserver&rdquo;); and the Liberals, Sir
Willoughby Jones, Bart. (Conservative member for Cheltenham in
1847), and Mr. Brampton Gurdon.&nbsp; The poll was opened on the
22nd, and the following was the result: Bagge, 2,710; de Grey,
2,611; Jones, 2,133; Gurdon, 2,088.&nbsp; A petition against the
return of the successful candidates was dismissed, owing to
informality in the recognisances.&nbsp; Great disturbances took
place at Swaffham, for which several persons were punished at the
ensuing Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; Mr. de Grey, on his return to
Merton, on the 24th, was most enthusiastically received at Watton
and other places on the route.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The comic singer Vance&mdash;&ldquo;the Great
Vance&rdquo;&mdash;made his first appearance in Norwich at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the original singer of
the absurd &lsquo;Slap Bang,&rsquo; and has better
recommendations, but the judicious portion of the audience could
not see enough in him to explain the great success he has
achieved in the Metropolis.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A reminiscence of the old convict days was
forthcoming in a case tried before Lord Chief Baron Pollock at
the Norfolk Assizes.&nbsp; Cornelius Bradnum, a fruit dealer, was
indicted for being feloniously and unlawfully at large at
Heckingham on February 6th, 1865, &ldquo;he having been
transported for the term of his natural life, in pursuance of a
certain judgment against him at the Norfolk Assizes on July 21st,
1847, on an indictment for burglary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The prisoner,
in his defence, made a remarkable statement, to the effect that
in consequence of his having given information of an intended
mutiny of the convicts at Gibraltar, his sentence was mitigated
to fifteen years.&nbsp; From Gibraltar he was sent to Swan River,
Western Australia, where the Governor gave him his ticket of
leave, and after &ldquo;serving his ticket&rdquo; he received a
free pardon.&nbsp; He then went to Callao, in Peru.&nbsp; One
evening, when <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>standing on the Mole, he was kidnapped, put upon an
American ship, and brutally ill-used and crippled.&nbsp;
Sixty-five dollars had been paid for him, but as he was useless
he was put ashore at Hamburgh, whence, after remaining some time
in hospital, he came to England.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he had left
at Callao the document conveying to him his free pardon.&nbsp;
The prosecution denied that a free pardon had been granted.&nbsp;
His lordship said it was for the prosecution to show that the
prisoner&rsquo;s statement was untrue, after using that statement
against him as evidence.&nbsp; The statement must be taken as
true until it was contradicted.&nbsp; It had not been
contradicted, and, he added, turning to the jury, &ldquo;It is
for you to say whether you believe it or not.&nbsp; I must say I
don&rsquo;t see why you should not believe it, and why he is not
entitled to a verdict of not guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury
acquitted the prisoner.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A large meeting of agriculturists was held at the
Swan Hotel, Norwich, for the purpose of considering what steps
should be taken to combat &ldquo;a disease known as the Russian
murrain, which had broken out among the cattle of
Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Clare Sewell Read, M.P., presided, and,
in the course of the proceedings, alarming reports were given of
the spread of the contagion and of the immediate steps that were
necessary to arrest its progress.&nbsp; A deputation, consisting
of Mr. Read, Mr. Steeds, Mr. W. Smith, and Mr. R. Leamon, was
appointed to wait upon the Home Office, and at a committee
meeting on the 9th Mr. Read reported what had taken place.&nbsp;
It was resolved, on the motion of Sir Thomas Beauchamp, who
headed the list with a donation of &pound;100, that a public
subscription be opened at once, and Professor Simonds, in a long
address, showed that the disease was of foreign importation, and
was known in Russia, whence it came, as rinderpest.&nbsp; At this
meeting it was reported that in the neighbourhood of North
Walsham alone losses to the extent of &pound;1,000 and upwards
had been sustained.&nbsp; Isolation of the herds and the
slaughter of diseased animals were the means advocated for
stamping out the murrain.&nbsp; A Norfolk Cattle Plague
Association was at once formed, and at a large and influential
meeting, held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall on the 12th, under the
presidency of Mr. Read, whose great services at this crisis were
acknowledged by the Earl of Leicester, resolutions were adopted
(1) recommending to the consideration of the public the means
suggested by Professor Simonds for dealing with the disease, and
urging that no farmer should purchase any store stock in any
market for the period of six weeks; (2) that a subscription be
entered into for the purpose of meeting the losses sustained by
those who should conform to the resolutions drawn up by the
committee, and for defraying the expenses incurred in carrying
out the objects of the meeting; and (3) that no person who did
not subscribe to the amount of twopence in the pound on his
assessment should participate in the relief.&nbsp; At this
meeting the Earl of Leicester contributed a donation of
&pound;500.&nbsp; Meetings of the Cattle Plague Association were
then held weekly, reports were presented upon the state of the
disease in various parts of the county, and matters of detail
received attention.&nbsp; On October 21st a public meeting was
held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, under the presidency of the Earl
of Leicester, &ldquo;to consider the desirability of closing all
markets in the county of Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Beauchamp moved, and the Earl of Albemarle seconded, a resolution
in favour of the adoption of this course, which was agreed
to.&nbsp; During this month Mr. Read was appointed a member of
the Royal Commission to inquire into the <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>causes of
cattle plague and to suggest remedies.&nbsp; The Commission
recommended the slaughter of animals and the stringent
prohibition of the passage of cattle across public roads,
&amp;c.&nbsp; At Norwich and elsewhere there were frequent
magisterial proceedings against dealers and others for
contravention of the Orders of Council; medical men and
veterinary surgeons suggested many remedies for the disease, and
quacks advertised their nostrums, but the end of the year found
the fatal rinderpest more rampant than ever.&nbsp; Science seemed
confounded by the insidious character of the outbreak, and
precautionary measures appeared to be vain to prevent its
extension.&nbsp; It was officially announced that from September
6th to December 20th compensation had been given in respect of
1,486 animals, to the amount of &pound;9,448 3s. 11d.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> February 23rd, 1866.)</p>
<p>8.&mdash;A barque named the Edgar, of 600 tons burthen, built
by Messrs. Fellows and Son, for the South American trade, was
launched from their shipyard at Southtown, Great Yarmouth.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The Earl of Leicester issued to the tenants on his
estate an address, in which he referred to an election circular
sent out to them during his absence in Norway, the spirit of
which he described as &ldquo;a flagrant contradiction of the
principles and practices that have been professed and followed on
the Holkham estate for nearly a century.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
lordship had counselled not coercion in any form, but the
adoption of every legitimate measure to achieve the return of Mr.
Gurdon and Sir Willoughby Jones at the West Norfolk election; but
the zeal of his agent (Mr. Shellabear) in carrying out
instructions which were only indicated and not given in detail
led him to issue a circular which had caused much scandal, the
impolicy and unfittingness of which no one now saw more clearly
than his lordship himself.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at Kew, Sir William Jackson Hooker, K.H.,
F.R.S., F.L.S., &amp;c., Regius Professor of Botany in the
University of Glasgow.&nbsp; Sir William was a native of Norwich,
where his father, Mr. Joseph Hooker, a manufacturer, took much
interest in horticulture, and possessed a rich collection of
succulent and other exotics.&nbsp; Hooker spent some of his
earlier years in the study of agriculture with Mr. Robert Paul,
of Starston Hall, but the death of a relative enabled him to
devote himself to his favourite pursuit, natural history.&nbsp;
With his brother, Mr. Joseph Hooker, the Rev. James Brown, and
other naturalists, he thoroughly explored the rich district of
the Norfolk Broads in the study of ornithology.&nbsp; He was the
author of several works, and editor of the &ldquo;Botanical
Magazine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Resigning the appointment of Regius
Professor for the curatorship of the Royal Gardens at Kew, he
received the honour of knighthood in 1835, and in 1845 had
conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L. by the University of
Oxford.&nbsp; He married a daughter of Mr. Dawson Turner, of
Yarmouth.&nbsp; His eldest son, Dr. Hooker, F.L.S., was no less
distinguished than his father for his valuable works in natural
history and for the scientific explorations with which his name
was associated.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;Died at Southwell, the Ven. Archdeacon Wilkins,
D.D.&nbsp; He was born at Norwich in 1785, and was the youngest
son of Mr. William Wilkins, F.S.A., and brother of the Professor
of Architecture in the Royal Academy.&nbsp; Educated at the
Grammar School, Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, under the headmastership
of Becher, he entered Caius College, Cambridge, in 1803, and
having received his degree, removed to Oxford <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>to
prosecute his favourite study of divinity.&nbsp; He was ordained
at Norwich in 1808, and was ultimately presented to the vicarage
of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Nottingham, where he ministered
single-handed to a population of 28,000.&nbsp; He was the author
of &ldquo;A History of the Destruction of Jerusalem,&rdquo; and
of several other works.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;A sculling match, known as the &ldquo;Great Lynn
Sweepstakes,&rdquo; was contested over the Ouse championship
course in the Eau Brink Cut, a distance of 3,300 yards.&nbsp; The
competitors were Robert Chambers, champion of the Tyne and
ex-champion of the Thames; Harry Kelley, who just previously had
wrested the championship of the Thames from his formidable North
country rival; and Robert Cooper, of Newcastle.&nbsp; The
sweepstakes amounted to &pound;50, with &pound;100 added by the
Lynn Regatta Committee.&nbsp; The conditions provided that if
three competed the winner should receive &pound;200 and the
second man &pound;50, and if only two came to the post a first
prize of &pound;200 only would be given.&nbsp; The race lay
between Cooper and Kelley alone.&nbsp; The former kept a slight
lead, and as Kelley&rsquo;s efforts to pass him were unavailing,
he rowed past the winning-post a quarter of a length ahead.&nbsp;
The referee decided that Kelley had won, disqualified Cooper on
the ground that he had taken the other man&rsquo;s water, and
awarded second prize to Chambers.&nbsp; At a meeting presided
over by the Mayor of Lynn (Mr. W. Monement), a protest was lodged
by Cooper&rsquo;s backers against the second prize being awarded
to Chambers.&nbsp; The Mayor decided to withhold the second prize
until the referee had been communicated with, and handed to
Kelley a cheque for &pound;200.&nbsp; Cooper&rsquo;s protest was
ultimately disallowed.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The 13th Hussars, with headquarters, arrived at
Norwich Cavalry Barracks.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;A prize-fight took place on Grimstone Common, between
Pooley Mace and a man named Rackaby.&nbsp; After five rounds had
been contested, the police stopped hostilities, and
Rackaby&rsquo;s party declining to resume the fight, the stakes
were awarded to Mace.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died at Clive House, Beckenham, Kent, in his 71st
year, Lieut.-Col. Henry Alexander, 96th Foot.&nbsp; He was born
at Caister, and entered the Army as ensign in the 28th Foot in
June, 1811.&nbsp; He received the war medal with six clasps for
Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;The first Church Congress commenced at Norwich.&nbsp;
The Congress sermon was preached at the Cathedral by the
Archbishop of York, and the first general meeting was held at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, presided over by the Bishop of
Norwich.&nbsp; The final meeting took place on the afternoon of
the 5th, after which the members of Congress attended luncheon,
given at the new bank by Mr. R. J. H. Harvey, M.P.&nbsp; Two
thousand guests were present.&nbsp; On the morning of the 6th,
the Bishop of Oxford preached the annual sermon at the Cathedral
on behalf of the Five Religious Societies.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>9.&mdash;Died at the house of Mrs. Church, Lady Lane,
Norwich, Bartholomew Gattey, &ldquo;the eccentric but clever
flute-player at the Theatre Royal.&rdquo;&nbsp; For forty years
he had scarcely been absent from his place in the orchestra of
the theatres in the Norwich circuit, &ldquo;a position to which
he fondly clung, in spite of many most favourable offers of
engagement that were made to him, and which, if accepted, would,
no doubt, have resulted in his obtaining a position in the
musical world of honour and emolument.&nbsp; At length a mind
never very strong gave way, and he was obliged to have recourse
to the assistance of his friends.&nbsp; Mr. Hewlett and other
gentlemen got up a concert for him in December, 1863, and
&pound;50 was realised, which, with Mr. Gattey&rsquo;s simple
habits, was sufficient for his maintenance until his
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. Gattey, a yarn
manufacturer, and a native of Norwich, and had attained his 64th
year.</p>
<p>14.*&mdash;&ldquo;Died at his residence, Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, Mr. Frederick Ladbrooke, portrait painter.&nbsp;
The deceased was the youngest son of the late Mr. Robert
Ladbrooke, one of the founders of the celebrated Society of
Norfolk and Norwich Artists.&nbsp; He was a painter of
considerable power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The ceremony of cutting the first sod of the East
Norfolk Railway was performed on the estate of Mr. C. Jecks,
Sheriff of Norwich, by Lady Suffield, in the presence of a large
number of spectators.&nbsp; In the evening a dinner, attended by
representatives of most of the principal families in the county,
was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, in celebration of
the event.&nbsp; Lord Suffield presided.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> August
13th, 1870.)</p>
<p>21.*&mdash;&ldquo;The Queen has been pleased to grant to
Edward John Stracey, of Sprowston, Lieut.-Colonel of the Scots
Fusilier Guards, her Royal licence and authority that he and his
issue may, in compliance with a clause contained in the last will
and testament of James Clitherow, take and use the name of
Clitherow in addition to that of Stracey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;A new lifeboat, named the James Pearce, was launched
at Yarmouth.&nbsp; It was built at the cost of &pound;350,
subscribed by the artisans of Birmingham, and presented through
the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to the Caister
station.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died at Hilgay, aged 110 years (as was originally
stated), Mr. John Naylor, formerly landlord of the Crown Hotel,
Downham Market.&nbsp; An amended notice, published on November
18th, says: &ldquo;The late Mr. John Naylor, who died on the 30th
ult., and was supposed by his eldest son to be <i>only</i> 110
years of age, appears from the parish register of Welney to be
117, he having been born on the 29th of May, 1748.&nbsp; In 1825
the deceased retired from his business as a publican, he having
kept the Crown at Downham and the George and Dragon at Hilgay in
succession, and had since lived on a small property of his own in
the latter village.&nbsp; He was always a smart, active man, and
constant in taking his walk up to October, 1860.&nbsp; Since that
time he had been confined to his house, but used to sit up in his
chair for some portion of the day until June, 1864, when he did
so for the last time.&nbsp; His sight had failed him, but his
hearing was so good that he could distinguish the voices of his
friends, and he was rational until within six weeks of his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Died of apoplexy, at his residence, Acton Green,
Middlesex, John Lindley, F.R.S., Ph.D., and formerly Professor of
Botany at University College.&nbsp; He was born at Catton, near
Norwich, in 1799, and was the son of a nurseryman.&nbsp; His
first literary effort, after devoting much of his early youth to
the practical details of botany, was the translation of
Richard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Analyse de Fruit&rdquo; from the French,
and the contribution of some papers to the Transactions of the
Linn&aelig;an Society.&nbsp; Afterwards he proceeded to London,
where he was engaged by Mr. Loudon to assist in the production of
the &ldquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia of Plants.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1832 he
published his &ldquo;Introduction to Systematic and Physiological
Botany,&rdquo; but his <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> was the
&ldquo;Vegetable Kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; For more than a quarter of
a century Dr. Lindley filled the chair of Botany at University
College, London, and in 1860 was appointed examiner in the
University of London.&nbsp; He was a member of several learned
bodies, and edited the horticultural department of the
&ldquo;Gardeners&rsquo; Chronicle&rdquo; from its commencement in
January, 1841, to the time of his death.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Lord Hastings, master of the East Norfolk Foxhounds,
was presented with his portrait in oil, subscribed for by 400
gentlemen of the Hunt.&nbsp; The portrait was painted by Mr.
Eddis, and his lordship was depicted in hunting dress, mounted on
Archer, his favourite hunter.&nbsp; Sir Willoughby Jones, Bart.,
made the presentation, on behalf of the subscribers.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The Marquis and Marchioness Townshend, whose marriage
had taken place a few weeks previously, were welcomed with great
enthusiasm on their return to Rainham, and were presented by the
tenantry with a handsome silver epergne.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. William Peter Nichols was elected Mayor, and Mr.
William Jary Cubitt appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died at Necton Hall, Colonel William Mason.&nbsp; He
was the head of an old county family, whose head, Paul Miller
Mason, a citizen of London, built Necton Hall in the time of
Henry VII.&nbsp; Col. Mason served the office of High Sheriff in
1849, was for many years a chairman of Quarter Sessions at
Swaffham, and was Lieut.-Colonel of the East Norfolk Militia.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;The Prince and Princess of Wales left Sandringham, on
a visit to Lord and Lady Suffield, at Gunton Park.&nbsp; Their
Royal Highnesses travelled by special train from Wolferton to
Lynn and thence to East Dereham, where they were received by Lord
Suffield, Viscount Hamilton, and the Hon. Harbord Harbord.&nbsp;
A guard of honour was formed by the 15th Norfolk Volunteer
Company, under the command of Capt. Bulwer, and their Royal
Highnesses, entering a carriage drawn by four greys, proceeded
along Norwich Road and the Market Place.&nbsp; Three triumphal
arches were erected in the town, which was handsomely decorated,
guns were fired, and the church bells rung, and in the evening
there was a display of fireworks.&nbsp; After leaving Dereham,
the Royal visitors proceeded by way of Swanton, Bylaugh, and
Bawdeswell <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>to Reepham, where the Aylsham Volunteers, commanded by
Capt. Scott, provided a guard of honour.&nbsp; At Aylsham their
Royal Highnesses were welcomed with great enthusiasm, and at
Gunton Park gates the North Walsham corps, commanded by Major
Duff, mounted a guard of honour.&nbsp; On the 5th and 6th the
Prince shot over the estate, and on the evening of the last-named
day a dinner and ball were given at the hall.&nbsp; On the 7th
his Royal Highness attended a meet of the East Norfolk Foxhounds,
and on the 8th shot on the Hanworth side of the hall.&nbsp; The
visit terminated on the 9th.&nbsp; The Prince and Princess had
arranged to honour Lord Sondes by attending luncheon at Elmham
Hall, but, owing to intelligence received of the critical
condition of the King of the Belgians, the visit was
postponed.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses left Elmham station by
special train, and arrived at Sandringham the same afternoon.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The Rev. J. M. Bellew gave public readings from the
great poets and other authors, with organ accompaniments, at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich.&nbsp; He was described as &ldquo;a
perfect master of the elocutionary art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died at Yarmouth, in his 71st year, Mr. Edward
Cubitt, of Honing Hall.&nbsp; He served in the Peninsular War
with the 4th Dragoons, was at the retreat from Burgos, and
received the medal with clasps for Vittoria, Pampeluna, and
Toulouse.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Christmas pantomime at Norwich Theatre was
entitled, &ldquo;Camaralzaman and Badoura, or the Little God of
Love and the Good Fairy of Lake Lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1866.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norfolk Agricultural Association,
held at the Swan Hotel, Norwich, it was decided to abandon the
annual show for that year, &ldquo;because the bringing of cattle
from all parts of the country would be inconsistent with what is
being done to prevent the transit of cattle during the prevalence
of the cattle plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by the
Hon. T. de Grey, arrived at Holkham, on a visit to the Earl and
Countess of Leicester.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their Royal Highnesses <i>de
facto</i> opened the new line of the West Norfolk Junction
Railway, which had been pushed forward by the contractor so as to
be ready for the purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was by this line that
the Prince and Princess travelled to Holkham.&nbsp; Their Royal
Highnesses returned to Sandringham on the 13th.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The first wintry weather of the season was
experienced on this date, when there was a considerable fall of
snow, accompanied by showers of rain and sleet, followed by a
sharp wind frost.&nbsp; Telegraphic communication with London was
suspended, in consequence of the blowing down of several miles of
the telegraph line.</p>
<p>&mdash;Lost in the Bay of Biscay, by the wreck of the
steamship London, on her voyage to Australia, the Rev. John
Woolley, <span class="smcap">D.C.L.</span>, <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>formerly
headmaster of Norwich Grammar School, Fellow of University
College, Oxford, and principal and professor of classics and
logic in the University of Sydney.&nbsp; Mr. G. V. Brooke, the
actor, formerly a member of the Norwich Company, went down in the
same ill-fated vessel.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The new building, then known as the Consolidated
Bank, London Street, Norwich, was opened for the transaction of
business.&nbsp; It was designed by Mr. R. M. Phipson, of Norwich
and Ipswich, and built by Mr. Hall, of Pottergate Street, at the
cost of &pound;4,000.&nbsp; It is now known as the National
Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>&mdash;A vessel running through Yarmouth Roads was observed to
be flying a &ldquo;waif.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two lifeboats, the Rescuer,
belonging to the Ranger Company, and the Friend of All Nations,
the property of the Young Company of Beachmen, put off to her
assistance.&nbsp; The Rescuer, in attempting to pass through the
rough water at the bar, unshipped her rudder, was capsized, and
twelve of her crew of sixteen were drowned.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Judgment was given in the Arches Court by Dr.
Lushington, in the action, Edwards and Mann <i>v.</i> Hatton,
otherwise known as the &ldquo;Mattishall Church Rate
case.&rdquo;&nbsp; The plaintiffs were the churchwardens, and the
defendant a parishioner of Mattishall.&nbsp; Hatton having
refused to pay the Church Rate, proceedings were taken in the
Arches Court to enforce it.&nbsp; The whole sum in dispute was
6s. 8d., but it had given rise to many months of litigation, to
much unpleasantness and ill-feeling in the parish, and to rioting
and disturbance.&nbsp; Two objections were urged against the
rate: (1) That proper notice had not been given on the church
doors, as provided by the Act of Parliament; and (2) that the
rate was unequal and unjust.&nbsp; The Court entered judgment for
the churchwardens, and condemned the defendant in the costs of
the protracted proceedings.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Under the Prisons Act, 1865, the old borough jail at
Lynn ceased to be used as a prison.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;Mr. F. W. Windham, who for five or six years had
enjoyed unenviable notoriety, died suddenly at the Norfolk Hotel,
Norwich.&nbsp; He had been unwell for several days, and was seen
by his medical attendant, Mr. F. C. Bailey, on January
31st.&nbsp; Mr. Windham became better on February 1st, and still
further improvement was manifested on the 2nd; but later in the
day his symptoms were completely altered, and became so alarming
that Mr. Bailey called in Dr. Bateman and Dr. Eade.&nbsp; Every
effort was made to restore animation, but without avail; this
victim of an ill-spent life gradually sank, and in a few hours
expired, in the presence of the medical men and of some of the
servants of the hotel.&nbsp; Death was due to the obstruction of
the circulation by a clot of blood in the pulmonary artery.&nbsp;
On the 7th the body was removed to Tucker&rsquo;s Hotel, Cromer,
and the interment took place on the 8th, in the family vault at
Felbrigg.&nbsp; Mr. Windham had completely dissipated the residue
of the extensive property which he inherited, after payment of
the law expenses contingent on the great suit, Windham <i>v.</i>
Windham (<i>q.v.</i> November 22nd, 1861), and became <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>dependent
for a livelihood on the little income he made as driver of the
Cromer coach.&nbsp; His uncle, General Windham, had made
arrangements by which he was supplied with the means of living
respectably.&nbsp; He had rooms at the Norfolk Hotel, but
generally spent his time in one or other of the low public-houses
in the city.&nbsp; The effect of his death was to deprive Mrs.
Windham of the annuity granted on Mr. Windham&rsquo;s life, and
of any interest whatever in the Hanworth estate.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;A case was heard at East Dereham Petty Sessions, in
which the points urged in the Corn Hall litigation in
1857&ndash;58 were again brought prominently before the
public.&nbsp; George Squire, a Lincolnshire merchant, was charged
with assaulting Charles Howard, the keeper of the Corn
Hall.&nbsp; He had paid twopence for admission, and Howard
informed him that he ought to take a merchant&rsquo;s ticket and
hire a stand.&nbsp; In the course of the altercation, defendant
took plaintiff by the collar and pinched his neck.&nbsp; Mr. J.
C. Chittock, solicitor, on behalf of the defendant, contended
that any person had a right to go into the hall, whether he paid
for doing so or not, because at the Summer Assizes in 1857 the
proprietors were indicted for obstructing a highway and a verdict
was given for the Crown.&nbsp; The hall was built upon a highway
known as Lion Hill, and Lion Hill had never ceased to be a
highway.&nbsp; The Bench determined that they had no
jurisdiction, and dismissed the case.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died at Great Yarmouth, Mr. Isaac Preston, aged 92
years.&nbsp; One of the oldest inhabitants of the borough, he
had, previous to the passing of the Municipal Reform Act, held
several important offices in connection with the Corporation, and
was twice Mayor.&nbsp; He was a justice of the peace and a
deputy-lieutenant for the county, and was one of the promoters of
the movement for the erection of the Nelson Column on the South
Denes.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A serious difficulty arose at Norwich, owing to the
operation of the Cattle Diseases Prevention Act.&nbsp; A large
number of dealers, apprehending that the provisions of the Act
would not be enforced until the following week, sent stock to
Norwich for the market on the 24th, or for transmission by rail
to London.&nbsp; Two hundred fat beasts arrived at Trowse for
conveyance, but the railway authorities refused to receive
them.&nbsp; Salesmen on the Hill experienced the same difficulty,
and dealers had to dispose of their cattle as best they
could.&nbsp; Many beasts were sent to butchers for immediate
slaughter; others were removed to Trowse.&nbsp; The Mayor (Mr.
Nichols) went down on the 25th to see what help he could render,
but the only way out of the difficulty was to send the animals to
the Norwich slaughter-houses, whence the principal portion of the
meat was forwarded to London.&nbsp; In order to obviate any
further difficulty of the kind, the Norwich Town Council, on the
27th, resolved to erect slaughter-houses and to provide a dead
meat market.&nbsp; The cattle plague continued with unabated
virulence.&nbsp; Thursday, March 8th, was observed as a day of
humiliation, business was suspended, and special services were
held at the Cathedral and the parish churches.&nbsp; Similar
services took place throughout the county.&nbsp; On June 30th it
was announced, &ldquo;Rinderpest is now nearly extinct in Norfolk
and Suffolk&rdquo;; and on October 13th it was stated: &ldquo;The
non-existence of the cattle plague in the county has rendered the
work of the Central Committee and the Cattle Plague Association
very light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Norwich Cattle Market was re-opened on
November 17th.</p>
<h4><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>MARCH.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;A dastardly attempt was made to destroy the church of
St. Lawrence, Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. David Penrice, the churchwarden,
accompanied by a lad, went to prepare the church for evening
service, and found it to be full of gas.&nbsp; The lad, on
endeavouring to open the windows, was overcome by the
fumes.&nbsp; Assistance was obtained, and it was discovered that
every burner in the church had been fully turned on.&nbsp; At the
Police Court, on the 21st, a lad named George Nobbs, described as
a shoemaker, of St. Martin-at-Oak, was charged with
&ldquo;wilfully and maliciously turning on the gas at St.
Lawrence&rsquo; church, thereby endangering the lives of her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; The offence was fully
proved, but the magistrates dismissed the case, on the ground
that &ldquo;the lad did not show he had any knowledge of the
consequences of the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.&mdash;A boiler explosion occurred at the brewery of
Messrs. Arnold and Wyatt, St. Margaret&rsquo;s Plain,
Norwich.&nbsp; William Whitworth, an engine driver, was killed,
&ldquo;his body being hurled into the beck containing six
quarters of boiling wort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The hearing of the petition against the return of
Sir E. H. K. Lacon and Mr. J. Goodson commenced, before a
Committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; Bribery, undue
influence, and treating were alleged.&nbsp; The inquiry concluded
on the 22nd, when the chairman (the Right Hon. J. R. Mowbray)
announced that the Committee had arrived at the unanimous
conclusion that the members had been duly elected.&nbsp; On April
12th Mr. Mowbray gave notice of his intention to move the
appointment of a Royal Commission &ldquo;to inquire into the
corrupt practices which prevailed at the last election for Great
Yarmouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Commissioners, Mr. Wyndham Slade, Mr.
Lucius Henry Fitzgerald, and Mr. George Russell, began their
sittings at the Town Hall on August 16th, and on September 11th
adjourned until October 3rd, on which day the proceedings
recommenced.&nbsp; The final adjournment took place on October
15th, the thirty-fourth day of the inquiry.&nbsp; Six hundred and
fifty-six witnesses were examined, and full investigations made
as to the elections of 1865, 1859, and 1857.&nbsp; The
Commissioners reported that corrupt and illegal practices
extensively prevailed, and in consequence the borough was
disfranchised.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The 13th Hussars marched from Norwich, <i>en
route</i> to Newcastle.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;In the course of a civil action, Creake <i>v.</i>
Smith, at the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Baron Martin, reference
was made to &ldquo;the science of Bibliomancy,&rdquo; as
practised by a &ldquo;cunning woman&rdquo; in the neighbourhood
of Wells-next-the-Sea.&nbsp; The defendant, who was landlord of
the Railway Hotel at Wells, had lost articles from his house, and
had consulted the woman with the view of discovering the
thief.&nbsp; A Bible was suspended by a string and made to
revolve; during its revolutions the names of several suspected
persons were called out, and it was alleged that it stopped on
the name of the plaintiff being mentioned&mdash;a clear proof
that he was the guilty person.&nbsp; The defendant returned to
the hotel, alleged that Creake was a thief, &ldquo;for he knew it
by the turn of the Bible,&rdquo; and dismissed him from his
service.&nbsp; Hence these legal proceedings for slander and
wrongful dismissal, which resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff
on the first count, and for the defendant on the second
count.</p>

Murray, seventh Earl of Dunmore, and Lady Gertrude Coke, third
daughter of the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk, took place at
Holkham.&nbsp; The ceremony was honoured by the presence of the
Prince and Princess of Wales, who arrived at the Hall on the 4th,
as the private guests of the Earl and Countess of Leicester.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Chequers Court, Herts., aged 56, Lieut.-Col.
Francis L&rsquo;Estrange Astley, commandant of the Norfolk
Militia Artillery.&nbsp; He was born in 1810, and married first
in 1835, Charlotte, second daughter of Mr. N. Micklethwait, of
Taverham; and secondly, in 1854, Rosalind Alicia, fifth daughter
of Sir Robert Frankland Russell, Bart.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The Norwich sewerage scheme was further considered
by the Town Council.&nbsp; A scheme known as the Hope scheme,
introduced at a previous meeting, was abandoned, and the future
management of the matter referred to a committee selected from
members opposed to the scheme.&nbsp; On May 12th appeared the
announcement that preliminary steps had been taken in Chancery by
the inhabitants of Thorpe and a bill filed against the Mayor and
Corporation for an injunction to compel them to desist from
emptying sewage into the river.&nbsp; On May 15th a special
committee reported that certain attempts made to cleanse the
river had been attended with considerable success, and at the
same meeting a memorial was presented by the inhabitants of the
city, expressing regret and disappointment at the abandonment of
the proposed plan for diverting the sewage from the river, and
stating that under no circumstances whatever should the stream be
made use of as a sewer.&nbsp; Acting upon counsel&rsquo;s
opinion, the Corporation, on May 31st, determined that it was
needful at once to take measures for the diversion of the sewage
from the river.&nbsp; The Sewerage Committee resigned, and a new
committee was appointed.&nbsp; This committee, on July 10th,
recommended the hiring &ldquo;of 1,300 acres of land on the Crown
Point estate, for the purpose of irrigating the same with the
Norwich sewage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The recommendation was agreed
to.&nbsp; On October 9th the Town Clerk was authorised, under the
direction of the Special Sewerage Committee, to give the
necessary notices to enable application to be made in the next
Session of Parliament for an Act of Parliament for carrying out
sewerage works, and for the preparation of the necessary plans to
be deposited in conformity with the Standing Orders of the
House.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 15th, 1867.)</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The Rev. John Alexander, minister of the Independent
congregation meeting at Prince&rsquo;s Street, Norwich, resigned
the pastorate of the chapel, after a service of nearly half a
century.&nbsp; Mr. Alexander <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>came to Norwich on April 4th, 1817,
and for a time officiated at the Tabernacle belonging to Lady
Huntingdon&rsquo;s Connexion.&nbsp; His small congregation next
met at the Lancastrian School, and in order to retain his
services they built the Prince&rsquo;s Street chapel, where he
ministered until the date of his resignation.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by the Rev. G. S. Barrett, B.A., of the Lancashire
Independent College.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died at Coltishall Hall, Mr. William
Burroughes.&nbsp; The younger son of a family seated in Norfolk
for considerably more than one hundred years, he was educated at
Norwich Grammar School &ldquo;in the palmy Valpeian days,&rdquo;
and at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He was upon the
commission of the peace for the county, chairman of the visiting
justices, and joint secretary of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The Great Yarmouth Fish Wharves and Tramways Bill
and the Great Yarmouth Haven, Port, and Rivers Bill, were before
a Committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; The first-named Bill
went through Committee without opposition on May 7th, and the
latter was ordered to be reported on May 28th.&nbsp; The Port and
Haven Bill, among other matters, provided that the Commission
should consist of thirteen members, namely, four for Yarmouth
(two to be elected by the Corporation, one by the registered
shipowners and payers of dues, and one by the owners of fishing
vessels and payers of dues on fish); three elected by the
justices of Norfolk; three by the justices of Suffolk; and three
by the Corporation of Norwich, one of each set of Commissioners
for Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich being a merchant residing and
carrying on business within the district for which he was
elected.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> October 28th, 1867.)</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;The organ at St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, restored by

Col. Astley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Intelligence was received from London that the
banking firm of Overend, Gurney, and Co. had been compelled,
owing to the panic in the money market, to suspend payment.&nbsp;
The announcement created great anxiety in Norwich, lest the firm
of Messrs. Gurney and Co. were involved.&nbsp; Public confidence
was restored by a notice issued by the firm, who stated that they
were in no way liable, and were not affected by the affairs of
Messrs. Overend, Gurney, and Co.&nbsp; A meeting of the citizens
was at once convened at the Guildhall, under the presidency of
the Mayor, and a resolution passed &ldquo;declaring publicly and
unhesitatingly its unbounded confidence in the house of Messrs.
Gurneys and Birkbecks, and its unabated reliance on its perfect
financial security.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 1st,
1869.)</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Mrs. Bulwer, wife of Capt. Bulwer, commanding the

<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The Marquis of Hartington having stated in the House
of Commons that as the troops would be accommodated in the new
barracks at Colchester, the Government intended to give up the
Cavalry Barracks at Norwich, and the lease having expired, the
buildings would be handed over to the Dean and Chapter of
Norwich, to whom they belonged, a meeting of citizens was held at
the Guildhall, at which a resolution was passed asking the
authorities to reconsider their determination.&nbsp; A deputation
consisting of the Earl of Leicester, the Earl of Albemarle, Lord
Suffield, the members of Parliament for the city, and other

<p>16.&mdash;A meeting was held at the Rampant Horse Hotel,
Norwich, to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the
intended closing of Victoria Station, under the Great Eastern
Railway (Additional Powers) Bill.&nbsp; A memorial was addressed
to the Town Council, calling attention to the fact that this was
the fourth attempt made by the company to close the terminus, and
that by the Act of Parliament which sanctioned the amalgamation
of the Eastern Union with the Eastern Counties Railway a special
clause was inserted for the sufficient maintenance of the
station.&nbsp; On these grounds the Corporation were asked to
oppose the Bill.&nbsp; At a meeting of the Town Council on the
17th, a letter was read from the company, in which they offered,
in consideration of being permitted to close the station, to
contribute &pound;1,000 <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>towards the improvement of Foundry
Bridge.&nbsp; The Council were not prepared to accede to the
proposition.&nbsp; When the Company&rsquo;s Bill was before the
Committee of the House of Commons, in March, 1867, the clause
providing for the abandonment of the station was disallowed.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;St. Giles&rsquo; church, Norwich, was re-opened,
after extensive restoration.&nbsp; A new chancel had also been
built, and a new organ, costing &pound;350, erected.&nbsp; The

Wilde, Coroner for Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Mr. Wilde the city
has lost an active and intelligent public officer and a useful

his shrewdness, accurate judgment, and devotion to their
interests, the Liberals of Norwich and elsewhere have been
indebted for many a triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wilde was a member
of the Court of Guardians, and for some time its chairman, and a
member of the Festival Committee.&nbsp; He had been Coroner for
thirty years.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;A new lifeboat, named the Leicester, was launched at

<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Died at his seat at Honingham, the Right Hon. and
Rev. Lord Bayning.&nbsp; His lordship was the second son of Mr.
Charles Townshend, who was created Baron Bayning in 1797, and
succeeded his brother, Charles Frederick, as third Baron on
August 2nd, 1823, when he assumed, by sign manual (in lieu of his
patronymic, Townshend), the name of his maternal grandfather,
William Powlett.&nbsp; Born on June 8th, 1797, he married, on
August 9th, 1842, Emma, only daughter of Mr. W. H. Fellowes, of
Ramsey Abbey, Huntingdon, by whom he had one son, who died twelve
months previously to his lordship&rsquo;s death, and the barony
thus became extinct.&nbsp; Lord Bayning was educated at St.
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1818,
and was appointed rector of Brome, Suffolk, in 1821, and rural
dean in the diocese of Norwich in 1844.&nbsp; He resigned the
rectory of Brome in 1847, and was appointed to the rectory of
Honingham with the vicarage of East Tuddenham in 1851.&nbsp; His
lordship was High Steward of Norwich Cathedral, Vice-President of
the Norwich Diocesan Association for the Propagation of the
Gospel, of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum, of the Norfolk and

contributed upwards of &pound;1,000 for its purchase.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Erle and a special jury, was tried the libel action, Athill
<i>v.</i> Soman.&nbsp; The declaration stated that the libel was
published in a newspaper called the &ldquo;Norwich Argus,&rdquo;
of which the defendant was the printer, and was contained in a
letter signed &ldquo;Honour Lingley,&rdquo; dated November 25th,
1865.&nbsp; The writer accused Athill, a superintendent of
police, of wrongfully ransacking her chests of linen at a house
at Sprowston called the &ldquo;Haunted Cottage,&rdquo; at which
disturbances had taken place, and where Athill had been present
in the discharge of his official duties.&nbsp; The damages were
laid at &pound;500; the jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff, damages one farthing.&nbsp; Application was made on
behalf of the plaintiff for costs, but his lordship held that
&ldquo;there was not a solitary instance of any personal malice
or ill-will on the part of the defendant,&rdquo; and refused
it.&nbsp; The county magistrates subsequently contributed to a
fund to defray the expenses of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;At the sale of the Lessingham House estate, by
Messrs. Hewitt and Capon, at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, a

<p>21.*&mdash;&ldquo;A destructive parasitical weed has made its
appearance on some of the small farms at Navarina, an open
district forming a part of the very extensive manor of Lord
Ashburton, at Thetford.&nbsp; It is known as &lsquo;the
dodder.&rsquo;&nbsp; It completely absorbs or destroys the crop
wherever it appears, and leaves the land barren of all but its
own hair-like fibres.&nbsp; So powerful and fatal is the grasp of
this singular plant, that even the hardy and prickly gorse
succumbs to the pressure of its delicate fibres.&rdquo;</p>

was raised, put in the caravan, and taken back to the fair green,
where she was placed in slings.&nbsp; Cordials and other

impaired in consequence of the large outlay required for making
alterations in and additions to the Grammar School
premises.&nbsp; The Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee, to whom
the memorial was referred, reported to the Town Council on
November 26th that they strongly deprecated <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>any
increase in the fees of the Commercial School, but they
considered the successful maintenance of the Grammar School of
great advantage to the city.&nbsp; The report was adopted.</p>

Herts., and formerly member of Parliament for Yarmouth.&nbsp; He
became a candidate for that borough with Mr. Rumbold, in the
Liberal interest, in 1837, when the Conservative candidates were
Messrs. Baring and Gambier.&nbsp; On the dissolution of
Parliament in 1847, he retired from the representation of the
borough.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is said that his various contests cost
him a very large sum of money, and that in other respects the
expenses incident to the representation of a borough on Liberal
principles were too much for endurance.&rdquo;</p>

Norfolk Light Horse, which had been under the command of Capt.

<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The Norfolk coast, in common with the whole of
England, was visited by a gale of unusual violence.&nbsp; It
resulted not only in great destruction of property, but in the
loss of many lives.&nbsp; At Yarmouth the waters overflowed the
banks of the river, inundated all the low-lying lands from the
harbour&rsquo;s mouth to Reedham, and, flooding the neighbouring
railways, stopped the traffic.&nbsp; Several vessels were driven
ashore and their crews lost.&nbsp; On December 2nd the lifeboat
Rescuer was entering the harbour with the shipwrecked crew of the
ship George Kendall, from Liverpool to Hull, on board, when she
fouled with a fishing-boat and was capsized.&nbsp; Of the
shipwrecked crew of twenty-three only four were saved, and of the
lifeboat crew six were drowned.&nbsp; Many widows and children
were left destitute, owing to the large number of lives lost
during the gale.</p>

fire.&nbsp; The building had recently undergone extensive
restoration, and the damage, due to the overheating of a new
warming apparatus, amounted to upwards of &pound;1,000.&nbsp;
Efforts were made by the Hingham fire brigade to preserve the
chancel, and were in part successful, but the nave was wholly
demolished.&nbsp; Under the supervision of Messrs. T. H. and F.
Healey, architects, of Bradford, the nave was rebuilt and the
chancel <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>24.&mdash;A common hall was held at the Guildhall, Norwich,
under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. J. J. Colman), at which

Fenian outrage at Clerkenwell, their sympathy with the sufferers,
and their loyal attachment to the Queen and the
Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Christmas pantomime produced by Mr. Sidney at
Norwich Theatre was entitled, &ldquo;Hush-a-Bye Baby on the Tree
Top, or Harlequin Fortunio, Clown King Frog of Frog Island, and

place.</p>
<p>&mdash;Lord Suffield, at the Norfolk Quarter Sessions, moved
the adoption of an address to her Majesty, expressing indignation
at the Fenian outrages committed throughout the kingdom, and
promising the hearty and vigorous co-operation of her
Majesty&rsquo;s loyal subjects in the county in supporting the
Government in any efforts that might be made &ldquo;to repress
this odious conspiracy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was stated on January
11th that at Yarmouth precautions had been taken to prevent an
outbreak in the borough.&nbsp; Each ward was under the special
supervision of two magistrates; the store of gunpowder was
removed from the outlying magazine at the North Battery to the
South Battery, where a strong guard was stationed; and directions
were given to the Artillery and Rifle Volunteers as to the course
to be pursued in the event of their services being required.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The Norwich Churchmen&rsquo;s Club was established
at a meeting held at the Clerical Rooms.&nbsp; It was intended
for &ldquo;the self-culture and rational recreation of young
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some years afterwards the society continued
to flourish, and was instrumental during the early period of its
existence in introducing to the city several eminent lecturers on
scientific and other subjects.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>16.&mdash;A remarkable seizure of about one hundred
coombs of wheat was made at the New Mills, Norwich.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;mass of filth, one-tenth wheat and nine-tenths rats&rsquo;
dung and maggots,&rdquo; had been sent to the mills by Mr.
Orlando Barnes, of Beeston, &ldquo;for the purpose of being
dressed for the preparation of human food.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
magistrates granted an order for its destruction, and on the 22nd
and 23rd it was publicly burned in the Cattle Market.&nbsp; At
the Norwich Police Court, on February 7th, Mr. Barnes was
summoned for sending the wheat to the mills with the view of
preparing it for human consumption, and was fined 40s. and
costs.&nbsp; The Norfolk Chamber of Agriculture, on February 8th,
discussed &ldquo;the policy of destroying agricultural produce by
any local authority under the Nuisances Removal Act, 1863,
without sufficient proof of its unfitness for feeding or some
other useful purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; A motion was adopted affirming
that such a practice was impolitic.&nbsp; In the following week
handbills were circulated calling upon the citizens to make an
&ldquo;indignation visit&rdquo; to Mr. Barnes&rsquo; premises at
Beeston on Sunday, February 16th.&nbsp; The Mayor issued notices
warning all persons to abstain from taking part in the proposed
proceedings, and the Chief Constable of the county (Col. Black)
drafted to the district thirty police-officers and eight mounted
inspectors and sergeants to prevent trespass upon the farm.&nbsp;
Several thousands of persons visited the village during the
afternoon, but a hostile demonstration was prevented.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The colours of the 54th (West Norfolk) Regiment,
bearing the marks of the severe conflicts through which they had
passed, were &ldquo;laid up&rdquo; at Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp;
They were brought from Aldershot on the 17th, in charge of Capt.
Shirecliff Parker, Lieut. Smart, Ensign Ibbetson, and two
colour-sergeants, and were deposited for the night at the
Guildhall.&nbsp; On the morning of the 18th the colours, escorted
by the 15th Hussars, and preceded by the band of that regiment,
were borne to the Cathedral.&nbsp; After Morning Prayer had been
said, Lieut. Smart carried the Queen&rsquo;s and Ensign Ibbetson
the Regimental colour to the altar rails, and, kneeling, handed
them to Canon Nisbet and Canon Heaviside, &ldquo;who placed them
leaning across the altar, one on the north and the other on the
south side&rdquo;; the National Anthem was played upon the organ,
and the officers and escort, who wore their busbies,
saluted.&nbsp; Canon Nisbet preached from Psalm xx., part of the
5th verse.&nbsp; The colours were subsequently placed in the
positions they now occupy in the choir.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A fire, involving the loss of three lives and the
destruction of much valuable property, occurred at the house of
Mr. Frederick Pigg, hosier and boot and shoe manufacturer, Market
Row, Yarmouth.&nbsp; Mrs. Pigg, in heroically attempting to save
her two children, was buried beneath the falling roof of the
building, and the charred remains of the mother and infants were
found the following day.&nbsp; The value of the property
destroyed was about &pound;3,500.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The first of the many long discussions upon the
sewerage question during this year took place at a special
meeting of the Norwich Town Council, on a recommendation of the
Sewerage Committee that a memorial from the citizens, praying for
the introduction of the dry earth system, instead of an expensive
scheme of drainage, be not adopted.&nbsp; It was decided that the
works had progressed too far to admit of any reconsideration of
the plans.&nbsp; On February 28th a large <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>meeting of
ratepayers was held at the Lecture Hall, St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
under the presidency of Sir Samuel Bignold, at which the
following resolution was passed:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Local
Board of Health be respectfully requested to postpone the
proposed drainage works, and that Messrs. Hay Gurney, Charles
Foster, J. Davey, and W. H. Clabburn and the other promoters of
the injunction be earnestly entreated not to interpose any
obstacle to the Board&rsquo;s compliance with this
request.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;injunctionists,&rdquo; on March
2nd, received a deputation appointed by the meeting, and, after
hearing their statements, Dr. Dalrymple replied on behalf of the
relators in the suit that they were of opinion &ldquo;the
question of proceeding with the scheme of drainage did not rest
with them but with the Town Council, and they were not prepared
to take any steps which would prejudice their legal position for
enforcing the purification of the river.&rdquo;&nbsp; On March
10th a memorial was presented to the Town Council, urging that
the drainage scheme in the then perplexity of sanitary science
was &ldquo;a speculation with the health of the city,&rdquo; and
that it was &ldquo;stark madness to plunge into a gulf of
unplumbed expenditure unwarned by the failures in other
cities.&rdquo;&nbsp; A motion was adopted authorising the
Sewerage and Irrigation Committee to negotiate for a loan not
exceeding &pound;60,000, required for the construction of
sewerage works.&nbsp; On the 17th a band paraded the city to
attract the citizens to a common hall, at which resolutions were
adopted affirming that the rates were too high and the trade of
Norwich too depressed to warrant this costly experiment in
drainage.&nbsp; The Town Council, on April 7th, entered into a
contract with Messrs. Shrimpton and Co., of Uxbridge Road,
London, for the construction of certain sewerage works, at the
cost of &pound;28,874; and it was agreed to take up at interest
of the Hand-in-Hand Fire and Life Office the sum of
&pound;30,000, of which &pound;20,000 was to be paid as soon as
the necessary security was prepared, and the remaining
&pound;10,000 at the expiration of six months, at the rate of
&pound;4 15s. per cent. per annum.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 5th,

over land at West Tofts, in the occupation of Mr. Colman, the
hare was shot by a gamekeeper in the service of that
gentleman.&nbsp; During the altercation which ensued Mr. Colman
appeared, and blows were exchanged between the members of the
Hunt and himself.&nbsp; Reinforcements came to Mr. Column&rsquo;s
assistance, and the engagement became general, the conflict
ending in favour of the Hunt.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Assizes, on
March 31st. before Mr. Baron Martin, was tried the action, Colman

estate and effects of Messrs. Riches and Watts, engineers, of
Norwich, brought a claim against William Cafferata, engineer, of
Newark, for the recovery of &pound;5,000 damages which had been
sustained by the estate of the bankrupts by reason of the
explosion of a steam boiler which they purchased of the defendant
and had supplied to Mr. Richard John Stark.&nbsp; It was
warranted to be of the very best metal, but was really of
inferior quality, and burst with disastrous consequences.&nbsp;
The defendant accepted a verdict against himself of &pound;2,000
damages.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died at Portsmouth, Rear-Admiral Robert Sharpe,

the Board of Guardians for the collection by one set of paid
collectors of all the public rates within the corporate district

report of a joint committee of the Corporation and the Guardians,
who recommended that the corporate district be divided into eight
districts; that the then four collectors be retained at the
salary of &pound;140 per year each; that four new collectors be
appointed, at the salary of &pound;100 a year each; that in
future two poor rates be made yearly, namely, one in January and

<p>26.&mdash;Died, Robert Monsey Rolfe, Baron Cranworth of
Cranworth.&nbsp; His lordship was the eldest and only surviving
son of the Rev. Edward Rolfe, and was born December 18th,
1790.&nbsp; His father, like his uncle, grandfather, and great
grandfather, was a plain country clergyman, holding the livings
of Cockley Cley and of Cranworth, and it was at the rectory house
of the latter parish that he was born, and from which he selected
his title just 60 years afterwards.&nbsp; His mother was a Miss
Alexander, a granddaughter of Dr. Monsey, the physician of
Chelsea Hospital.&nbsp; Having received his early education at
Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, he was transferred to Winchester
College, and in due course proceeded to Cambridge, took his B.A.
degree as 17th wrangler in 1812, and was elected to the
Fellowship of Downing College.&nbsp; He entered Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn, and was called to the Bar in 1816.&nbsp; One of his first
public appointments was that of Recorder of Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, and he more than once, as a Liberal, contested
the representation of the borough against the powerful interest
of the Marquis of Bristol.&nbsp; In 1832 he obtained a silk gown,
and in the same year was returned to Parliament.&nbsp; On
becoming Solicitor-General, in 1834, he received the honour of
knighthood, and at the close of 1839 accepted a puisne judgeship
as one of the Barons of Exchequer.&nbsp; In 1850 he was nominated
a Vice-Chancellor, a post which, in the following year, he
exchanged for that of a Justice of Appeal in Chancery, which he
continued to hold until the Great Seal of the kingdom was
entrusted to his hands by Lord Aberdeen, on the formation of the
Coalition Cabinet in December, 1852.&nbsp; In the same year he
was raised to the Peerage, and as Lord Cranworth again held the
Great Seal in 1865&ndash;66.&nbsp; His lordship married Miss
Carr, of Froghall Park, Hampstead.</p>

captive state, it made several ascents.&nbsp; The aeronaut,
accompanied by Mr. William Maris, then ascended to the height of
10,000 feet in the space <a name="page180"></a><span

generally voted with the class of politicians formerly known as
&ldquo;Peelites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Died at Westgate House, near Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, Rear-Admiral Sir William Legge George
Hoste.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Sir William Hoste (who was
created baronet in 1814 for his naval services, but particularly
for the victory he gained over the combined French and Italian
squadrons off the island of Lessa in 1811), and Lady Harriett,
third daughter of Horatio, second Earl of Orford.&nbsp; Born on
March 19th, 1818, he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of
his father, in December, 1828.&nbsp; He was Gentleman Usher to
Queen Adelaide from 1845 to 1849, and was appointed
Groom-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria in 1860.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>21.&mdash;Died, from the effects of an accident, caused by a
fall from his <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>horse whilst riding from Cringleford to Earlham, Mr.
Charles Evans, barrister-at-law, and Chancellor for the Diocese
of Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Evans was born at Harrow in 1798, and was
the eldest son of the Rev. Benjamin Evans, formerly a Fellow of
Pembroke College, Cambridge, and for many years assistant-master
at Harrow School.&nbsp; After remaining a short time at Eton, he
proceeded to Pembroke College, where he took his degree in 1819,
as twelfth wrangler, and was afterwards elected a Fellow.&nbsp;
On being called to the Bar Mr. Evans joined the Norfolk Circuit,
and in 1824 settled in Norwich, where he practised to the time of
his death.&nbsp; In 1845 he was appointed by Bishop Stanley to
the Chancellorship of the diocese.&nbsp; He was acting judge of
the Court of Record, Chairman of the Board of Guardians, to which
office he was elected on the passing of the new Act in 1863;
president of the directors of the Norwich Union Office, a
magistrate of the city, chairman of the Governors of the Grammar

<p>31.&mdash;The Earl of Leicester presided at a meeting of the
inhabitants of the county and city, held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, Norwich, &ldquo;for the purpose of bringing the affairs of
the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital before the public.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Resolutions were adopted affirming that the resources of the
institution were inadequate to meet the annual expenditure, and
as a means of increasing the revenue it was desirable &ldquo;that
on one Sunday at least in every year, as far as possible on the
same Sunday, collections be made for the benefit of the Norfolk
and Norwich Hospital in places of worship throughout the diocese,
where such collections shall not interfere with the claims of
other hospitals.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the resources of the Hospital
were heavily drawn upon by casualty cases, a separate fund called
the Accident Fund was established.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Edward Kerrison Harvey was elected Mayor and Mr.
John Robison appointed Sheriff of Norwich.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;For the second time since its erection in
1857&ndash;8, the Britannia pier at Yarmouth was partially
destroyed.&nbsp; Built at the cost of &pound;6,000, it was
originally 750 feet in length.&nbsp; On October 25th, 1859,
during a tremendous gale, a sloop, driven from her anchors, was
dashed upon the pier and divided it into two portions.&nbsp; It
was deemed advisable not to rebuild the severed portion, 80 feet
in length, and the terminal portion was subsequently
removed.&nbsp; During a heavy north-east gale on this date the
schooner Seagull, of Lynn, parted from her anchors, and, drifting
towards land, struck against the north side of the pier.&nbsp;
The crew of six hands speedily scrambled upon the structure and
escaped, but about 105 feet of the centre portion of the pier was
completely torn away and damage done to the amount of nearly
&pound;1,000.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The nomination of candidates for Norwich, to be
elected under the new Reform Act, took place at the
Guildhall.&nbsp; The Liberal candidates were Col. Sir William
Russell, Bart., C.B., Charlton Park, Charlton Kings, Gloucester,
and Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett; and the Conservative candidates Sir
Henry Josias Stracey, Bart., of Rackheath, who had been selected
about a fortnight previously.&nbsp; The show of <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>hands was
in favour of the Liberals, and Sir Samuel Bignold demanded a
poll, which was opened on the 17th &ldquo;at 29 polling places
most conveniently arranged in the different wards.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The pronouncement of the electorate at this election was upon the
Irish Church, and at Norwich, as elsewhere, a severe contest
resulted.&nbsp; The poll closed at four o&rsquo;clock with the
return of Sir William Russell and Sir Henry Stracey, the figures
being officially declared on the 18th as follow:&mdash;Stracey,
4,521; Russell, 4,509; Tillett, 4,364.&nbsp; Sir Henry Stracey,
accompanied by Lady Stracey, on the morning of the 18th was
escorted from Rackheath Park to Norwich, by his mounted tenantry,
and received at Magdalene Gates by an imposing procession of
Conservative electors, who, amid the playing of brass bands and
the ringing of St. Peter Mancroft bells, accompanied him to the
Guildhall.&nbsp; After the declaration the procession, half a
mile in length, marched through the city.&nbsp; Mr. Tillett, in
an address to the electors, stated: &ldquo;The Tory party have,
beyond all precedent, and in the most undisguised manner,
committed themselves to the disgrace involved in the wholesale
purchase of votes.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 14th,
1869.)</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The nomination of representatives to serve in
Parliament for the Western Division of the county took place at
Swaffham, when Sir William Bagge, Bart., and the Hon. Thomas de
Grey were re-elected without opposition.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The nomination of candidates for the borough took
place at King&rsquo;s Lynn.&nbsp; Lord Stanley and the Hon.
Robert Bourke were nominated by the Conservatives, and Sir Thomas
Fowell Buxton, Bart., by the Liberals.&nbsp; The poll was opened
on the 18th, and resulted as follows:&mdash;Stanley, 1,265;
Bourke, 1,125; Buxton, 1,012.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 16th,
1869.)</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at his residence, Surrey Street, Norwich, in his
82nd year, Mr. Thomas Brightwell.&nbsp; A native of Ipswich, he
married the only daughter of Mr. W. M. Wilkin, of Costessey, and
settled in Norwich, where he resided for 60 years, and practised
as a solicitor.&nbsp; An earnest Nonconformist, he joined the
congregation which assembled at the Old Meeting in St.
Clement&rsquo;s, where to the close of his life he officiated as
one of the deacons.&nbsp; He was the author of a work on the
Pentateuch, and his intellectual attainments and scientific
pursuits gained him admission into the circle which included
William Taylor, Doctors Sayers, Martineau, Rigby, and Barrow, Sir
James Smith, and other Norwich celebrities.&nbsp; Men bearing
historic names, and of widely different sentiments, had from time
to time been entertained beneath his roof&mdash;Williams, Dr.
Gary, Moffat, Doctors Philip and Wolff, of missionary fame;
Joseph Kinghorn, the eloquent Irving, Belzoni, the Egyptian
explorer; Professor Sedgwick, George Borrow, and many others who
had done good service in the cause of religion, literature, and
science.&nbsp; A close observer of nature, Mr. Brightwell gave
much of his time to entomology, and a fine collection of insects
in the Norfolk and Norwich Museum was formed by him.&nbsp; But
the study to which, in his later years, he devoted especial
attention was that of Infusoria.&nbsp; A treatise upon Infusoria,
illustrated from drawings by his daughter, was written by Mr.
Brightwell and printed for private circulation.&nbsp; At the
Norwich Congress of the British Association, of which he was a
vice-president, he was greatly amused by the anxious and
ineffectual endeavours made by several of the scientific men
present to procure <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>copies of the work, then out of print.&nbsp; In 1821
Mr. Brightwell became a Fellow of the Linn&aelig;an Society, and
he also rendered considerable assistance in the formation of the
Norfolk and Norwich Literary Institution and of the Norfolk and
Norwich Museum.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The nomination of candidates for South Norfolk took
place at the Shirehall, Norwich.&nbsp; The Conservative

of Harleston, was nominated by the Liberals.&nbsp; The polling,
on the 24th, resulted as follows: Read, 3,097; Howes, 3,055;
Hudson, 1,679.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The following gentlemen were nominated at Aylsham to
contest the new constituency of North Norfolk:&mdash;Sir Edmund
Knowles Lacon, Bart., and the Hon. Frederick Walpole,

Football Club has been started, and has already begun to play
upon the Norfolk and Norwich Cricket Ground.&nbsp; Mr. Croker has
been elected president, and Mr. Edward A. Field treasurer and
secretary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The members made their public
<i>d&eacute;but</i> on February 5th, 1869, in a match against
King Edward VI. School.&nbsp; (This is the first reference to
football, as distinct from the old game of camp ball, made in the
columns of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>.)</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The pantomime produced at Norwich Theatre was
entitled &ldquo;The White Fawn, or the Loves of Buttercup and
Daisy and the Fairies of the Coral Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie (then owned by Mr. Fairgrieve, of
Edinburgh) was exhibited, &ldquo;Prince Bonta Workey, son of the
late King Theodore, who held lev&eacute;es in his grand state

<p>&mdash;Died at his residence, Chapel Field Road, Norwich, Mr.
Trivet Allcock, in his 80th year.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was an active
politician and staunch Liberal, and had associated in his earlier
life with men like William Taylor and others, whose superior
learning formerly made Norwich celebrated.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;At the justices&rsquo; room of the Mansion House,
London, John Henry Gurney, Henry Edmund Gurney, Robert Birkbeck,
Henry Ford Barclay, Henry George Gordon, and William Rennie,
directors of Overend, <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Gurney, and Company, Limited, were
summoned for having, in July, 1865, and at divers other times,
conspired to defraud Dr. Adam Thom and others who became
shareholders in the company, of money to the amount of three
millions sterling.&nbsp; The defendants, on the 27th, were
committed for trial, and were admitted to bail, each of them in
the sum of &pound;10,000, with two sureties of &pound;5,000
each.&nbsp; The trial commenced in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench on December 13th, before the Lord Chief Justice, who summed
up on December 22nd, and the jury, after a few minutes&rsquo;
deliberation, returned a verdict of not guilty.&nbsp; Intense
excitement prevailed in Norwich during the trial, and on December
22nd, when the result was telegraphed to the city, it was
everywhere hailed with great satisfaction.&nbsp; A remarkable
scene occurred at Norwich Corn Hall, where a sale was in progress
when the intelligence was received.&nbsp; The proceedings were
stopped by cheering, the waving of hats, and other demonstrations
of approval, and the auctioneer, addressing the company, said,
&ldquo;The name of Gurney was an honoured name in Norwich.&nbsp;
The Gurneys had ever been friends of the poor and kind and good
to all classes, and all were glad that the trial had resulted in
the honourable acquittal of all the defendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&mdash;At the Lambeth Police Court, William Sheward, aged
57, was charged upon his own confession with the wilful murder of
his wife, Martha Sheward, at Norwich, on June 15th, 1851.&nbsp;
On the night of January 1st the prisoner went to the Carter
Street Police Station and said to the officer in charge, &ldquo;I
have killed my wife.&nbsp; I have kept the secret for years, but
I can keep it no longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a further statement he
said he had intended to destroy himself, &ldquo;but the Almighty
would not let him do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added that he had cut up
his wife&rsquo;s body, and that a portion was kept in spirits of
wine at the Guildhall at Norwich, by order of the
magistrates.&nbsp; At the Norwich Police Court, on January 4th,
the Chief Constable (Mr. Hitchman) detailed to the magistrates
the particulars reported to him by the London police, and stated
that on June 21st, 1851, portions of a human body were found in
different parts of the city and deposited at the Guildhall.&nbsp;
The magistrates issued a warrant for the apprehension of Sheward,
who, on January 7th, was brought to Norwich, and appeared before
the Bench on January 8th.&nbsp; He was described as a licensed
victualler, of the Key and Castle public-house, St.
Martin-at-Oak, and it was proved that he married his first wife,
a Norfolk woman, who formerly lived at Wymondham, at Greenwich,
on October 28th, 1836.&nbsp; In 1838 he came to Norwich, opened a
pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop in St. Giles&rsquo;, and became
bankrupt.&nbsp; When living in Tabernacle Street, in 1851, his
wife suddenly disappeared, about the 9th or 10th of June.&nbsp;
Upon this evidence the prisoner was remanded, and at subsequent
hearings witnesses were called who deposed to finding various
portions of human remains in different parts of the city and
suburbs in the summer of 1851.&nbsp; Relatives of the deceased
woman stated that the prisoner accounted for her disappearance by
saying that she had left Norwich for a time.&nbsp; On February
1st the prisoner was fully committed for trial.&nbsp; At the
Norwich Assizes, on March 29th, before Mr. Baron Pigott, Sheward
was placed upon his trial, and on the second day of the hearing
Mr. Metcalfe, Q.C., for the defence, contended that the accused
was labouring under delusions when he made the confession.&nbsp;
The jury, after three-quarters of an hour private deliberation,
returned a verdict of guilty, and the prisoner, who had nothing
to say, was sentenced to death.&nbsp; Immediately after <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>the trial
anonymous letters were published in the London newspapers
asserting the innocence of the prisoner; similar letters were
addressed to the Magistrates&rsquo; Clerk at Norwich, and one
communication actually purported to have been written by Mrs.
Sheward herself.&nbsp; Efforts were made to obtain a commutation
of sentence, on the ground of the long interval that had elapsed
between the perpetration of the murder and the trial of the
accused.&nbsp; These efforts, however, were of no avail, and the
capital sentence was carried out by Calcraft at the City Gaol on
April 20th.&nbsp; This was the first private execution that had
taken place in Norwich.&nbsp; It was announced that on April 13th
the culprit made a full confession of his crime, and gave
detailed particulars of the manner in which he had disposed of
the body of the murdered woman.&nbsp; In a letter to his second
wife he also admitted his guilt.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The trial of the election petition presented by Mr.
Jacob Henry Tillett against the return of Sir Henry Josias
Stracey, Bart., as member of Parliament for Norwich, commenced at
the Shirehall, before Mr. Baron Martin.&nbsp; Counsel for the
petitioner were Mr. Serjeant Ballantyne, Mr. Keane, Q.C., and Mr.
Simms Reeve; and for the respondent, Mr. Rodwell, Q.C., Mr.
Serjeant Sleigh, Mr. E. L. O&rsquo;Malley, and Mr. J. C. C.
Wyld.&nbsp; Bribery, treating, personation, and other matters
were alleged.&nbsp; In his opening address, Mr. Ballantyne
asserted &ldquo;that the bribery was most profligate and most
wholesale, and that houses were opened by persons of apparent
respectability for the mere purpose of carrying out this bribery,
and men of position who ought to have known a great deal better
were concerned in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; After three days&rsquo;
hearing, the trial resulted in the unseating of Sir Henry
Stracey.&nbsp; The learned judge, in his report to the Speaker of
the House of Commons, stated that although no corrupt practice
was proved to have been made with the knowledge or consent of any
of the candidates, and, further, it was proved to his entire
satisfaction that neither Sir Henry Stracey nor the other
candidates at the said election had any personal knowledge of or
connection whatever with bribery or any other illegal or corrupt
practice, he had determined that Sir Henry Stracey was not duly
elected, and that his election was rendered void by the acts of
his agents.&nbsp; The persons reported for being guilty of
corrupt practices were Robert Hardiment, Arthur Hunt, Robert
Callow, and Thomas Hutchings.&nbsp; The first-named absconded
after the petition was presented.&nbsp; It was also stated in the
report that a number of persons went to the poll in a gross state
of drunkenness.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 1st.)</p>
<p>15.&mdash;A trout weighing 15 lbs. was captured in a drop net
near the New Mills, Norwich.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Messrs. Jolly and Son, coachbuilders, Norwich,
advertised that they had &ldquo;arranged to supply from a noted
French maker the celebrated bicycle velocipede, so much in vogue
in Paris.&rdquo;&nbsp; The price of the machine was from 8 gs.
upwards.&nbsp; On the 30th there was an editorial announcement to
the effect that &ldquo;an attempt is being made to introduce this
latest novelty in locomotive machinery, now so fashionable in
Paris, to the Norwich public, by Mr. C. Thorn, who has two at his
establishment, for the inspection of the curious.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The &ldquo;first velocipede journey of any considerable distance
from Norwich&rdquo; was performed on March 30th by Mr. B. W.
Jolly, who travelled from Norwich to Yarmouth, including a
stoppage of fifteen minutes at Acle, in 2 hours 30 minutes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The progress of the traveller was considerably retarded by
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>the
roughness of the roads and a powerful gale.&rdquo;&nbsp; A short
time previously Mr. G. W. Bellamy, of Saxlingham, on a velocipede
built by Messrs. Jolly and Son, but under much more favourable
conditions as to roads and weather, accomplished a distance of 56
miles in 6 hours 25 minutes, exclusive of a short delay midway on
the journey.&nbsp; A Norwich Velocipede Club was established in
the month of April, and on the 29th an exhibition of the machines
was held at the Corn Hall, under the management of Mr.
Thorn.&nbsp; On the same occasion was exhibited &ldquo;one of the
old-fashioned dandy horses, the original or the velocipede
tribe,&rdquo; but, it was added, &ldquo;the now velocipede is
more easily managed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first velocipede races took
place at the athletic sports of the Norwich Gymnastic Society,
held on Newmarket Road Cricket Ground, on May 24th.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;slow race,&rdquo; ridden by Messrs. Jolly, Griffiths, and
Goldsmith, was won by the last-named.&nbsp; A &ldquo;plank
race,&rdquo; in which the bicycles were ridden upon a seventy
yards&rsquo; length of plank, was won by a competitor named
Ewing.&nbsp; A one mile &ldquo;fast race&rdquo; was ridden in
heats, the first of which was won by Kent, of Beccles, and the
second by Bellamy.&nbsp; Kent was the winner of the final heat,
in 4 minutes 49 seconds.&nbsp; &ldquo;He came over on his bicycle
from Beccles in the morning, and returned the same way after the
sports.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the end of the year there was a marked
increase in the number of local cyclists.&nbsp; Accidents to
inexperienced riders were frequently recorded, and many
complaints were made by drivers of the alarm occasioned to horses
by the appearance of these new-fangled machines.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The so-called monastic chapel erected at Elm Hill,
Norwich, by Father Ignatius, was the subject of further
discussion.&nbsp; Miss Robinson, a &ldquo;lady preacher,&rdquo;
had hired the &ldquo;monastery,&rdquo; and named it the
&ldquo;Jehovah Jireh chapel,&rdquo; whereupon Ignatius issued a
notice warning her and others concerned that he was the owner of
the building.&nbsp; On this date &ldquo;Brother Philip&rdquo; and
one or two other members of the confraternity came to Norwich,
under instructions from Ignatius, and demanded the keys of the
building from Mr. Liddlelow, who refused to give them up unless
authorised by his principal, Mr. Backhouse, surveyor, of
Ipswich.&nbsp; At midnight on the 18th Ignatius, who had arrived
in Norwich a few hours previously, with other brethren, gained
access to the old sanctuary by, they asserted, miraculous
intervention, and thence made their way to the new chapel.&nbsp;
The police were sent for, and Ignatius was informed that he had
no right there; as he declined to leave the building, the police
refused to interfere.&nbsp; Mr. Liddlelow, on the 19th, applied
to the magistrates for an order of ejectment, but as a question
of right was involved, they would have nothing to do with the
matter.&nbsp; On the same evening Ignatius performed service in
the chapel, and stated, in the course of his address, that Miss
Robinson had acted in the most honourable manner, but had been
misled by others.&nbsp; He alluded to her as his &ldquo;sister in
Christ,&rdquo; and Miss Robinson, who preached in the chapel on
the evening of the 20th, spoke of Ignatius as her &ldquo;brother
in Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ignatius addressed the congregation at
the close of the proceedings, and informed them that he should
never allow the chapel to be used for any other purpose than that
of monastic worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although the members of Father
Ignatius&rsquo; congregation and the members of Miss
Robinson&rsquo;s flock could not be more opposed in their mode of
thought, yet the greatest harmony prevailed, and at the close
they offered up the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in perfect
unison.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>18.&mdash;The new Cemetery at Diss was consecrated by
the Bishop of Norwich.&nbsp; The total cost of the chapels,
lodge, &amp;c., was about &pound;1,750, but this sum was
exclusive of the price of the land.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Died, in his 87th year, at Norwich, Thomas Hurry,
church bell-hanger, and for more than 50 years a member of the
St. Peter Mancroft company of ringers.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;A severe gale occurred on the Norfolk coast.&nbsp;
The barque Try Again was lost off Yarmouth, and the crew saved by
means of the rocket apparatus.&nbsp; Other vessels were wrecked,
and several lives lost.</p>
<p>13.*&mdash;&ldquo;We are sorry to learn that the Norfolk
County Cricket Club has been brought to an untimely end.&nbsp;
The officers of the club hold out no hope that it can be carried
on, as the persistent apathy of those who call themselves
members, many of whom have failed to pay their subscriptions, has
left the treasurer with a large amount of debts and no hope of
being able to meet them.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a meeting held on the
17th, it was agreed by the Dereham Cricket Club to hire the
ground hitherto let to the County Cricket Club.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a report
was received from the Sewerage and Irrigation Committee, stating
that an intimation had been made by the contractor for the
construction of the intercepting sewers that he would be unable
to proceed with his contract unless the Committee advanced him a
sum of money.&nbsp; As neither the Committee nor the Board of
Health had power to do so under the contract, proposals were made
to the contractor (Mr. Wainwright), which resulted in the
Committee taking possession of the works, materials,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The opinion was expressed that the Committee had
acted with due consideration of the interests and safety of the
public, and at the same time with consideration for the
contractor, who appeared to have met with unforeseen difficulties
in the prosecution of that part of the works in course of
construction at Trowse, the soil there consisting of sand
instead, as was supposed, of chalk.&nbsp; The Town Council, on
March 16th, agreed that the contract with Mr. Wainwright be
cancelled, upon payment to the parties entitled thereto of
&pound;2,800, in full satisfaction of all claims and for the
purchase of plant and materials.&nbsp; On July 20th the Sewerage
and Irrigation Committee reported that, in consequence of the
nature of the soil through which so large a portion of the
tunnelling had to be carried, and other unforeseen circumstances,
the original estimate would be exceeded, but the ultimate cost of
the works would not be more than &pound;81,500, to be reduced to
&pound;78,500 by the sale of plant, &amp;c.&nbsp; A description
of the sewerage works was published on December 24th, from which
it appeared that all the money authorised to be raised by Act of
Parliament, &pound;75,000, had been borrowed, and the greater
part of it already expended.&nbsp; The whole of the high level
sewer was completed on this date.&nbsp; It extended from the
Ipswich Road, along Town Close Road, through Mount Pleasant Lane,
across the fields and under Mill Hill <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Lane to West Pottergate street,
Bedford Street, Opie Street, the Cattle Market, and King Street,
to a point near Messrs. Morgan&rsquo;s Brewery, where it joined
the low level sewer, a distance of more than two and a half
miles.&nbsp; Branch sewers had been laid in various
directions.&nbsp; The low level sewer, from the New Mills, along
Westwick Street, Charing Cross, St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
Prince&rsquo;s Street, Tombland, Upper King Street, and along
King Street to the gates had also been completed, a few short
distances excepted.&nbsp; The work was carried out under the
direction of the engineer, Mr. Morant, and of the Sewerage and
Irrigation Committee, of which Mr. J. G. Johnson was
chairman.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> October 1st, 1872.)</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Torquay, Sir John P. Boileau, Bart., of
Ketteringham Park.&nbsp; The eldest son of Mr. John Peter
Boileau, he was born in 1794, educated at Eton and Merton
College, Oxford, and in 1813 entered the Rifle Brigade, from
which he retired in 1818.&nbsp; He married, in 1824, Lady
Catherine Sarah Elliot, daughter of the first Earl of Minto, by
whom he had two sons, Francis George Manningham, born in 1830,
who succeeded to the baronetcy, and Edward William Pollin, born
in 1831, and five daughters.&nbsp; Sir John was a magistrate and
Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Norfolk, and served the
office of High Sheriff in 1844.&nbsp; As a memorial to his wife,
who died in 1862, he founded the Catherine ward in the Norfolk
and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; He was devoted to the pursuit of
science and the arts, was a vice-president of the Society of
Antiquaries, a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of
Artists, president of the Norfolk and Norwich Arch&aelig;ological
Society, vice-president of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum, and a
member of the committee of the Norfolk and Norwich Triennial
Musical Festival.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Prince&rsquo;s Street chapel, Norwich, was
re-opened, after having been re-arranged and improved, under the
direction of Mr. Edward Boardman, architect, at the cost of
&pound;2,600.&nbsp; As originally planned, in 1819, it was a
building of heavy and uninteresting appearance; the new designs
by Mr. Boardman gave to it an imposing fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp; The
Rev. Newman Hall preached at the opening services.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;A race took place between Joseph Tuck, a pedestrian,
of Little Snoring, and a trotting pony belonging to Mr.
Gutteridge.&nbsp; The match was for &pound;40, the distance 500
yards, and the start was from scratch.&nbsp; Tuck had the race in
hand the whole way, and passed the winning-post thirty yards
ahead of the pony.</p>
<p>13.*&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Bunnett, of Norwich, has successfully
undergone the necessary preliminary of the searching examination
in music by Professor Sterndale Bennett.&nbsp; As a corollary of
the examination, the exercise of Mr. Bunnett for the degree of
Doctor in Music was performed in the chapel of Trinity College,
Cambridge, on the 8th instant, in the presence of Professor
Bennett, and produced a very good impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The trial of the election petition against the
return of the Hon. R. Bourke, one of the Conservative members for
the borough, commenced at King&rsquo;s Lynn, before Mr. Baron
Martin.&nbsp; The petitioners alleged corrupt practices,
treating, and intimidation.&nbsp; The hearing concluded on the
17th, when the Judge stated that he was clearly of opinion that
the object of the petition had failed, and it would be his duty
to report to the Speaker of the House of Commons that Mr. Bourke
had been duly elected.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>27.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Baron
Pigott, Francis Howard Clare (42), shoemaker, was indicted for
the wilful murder of his wife, Ann Frances Clare, on October
16th, 1868.&nbsp; The woman was found with her throat cut, and it
was alleged that the prisoner had inflicted the wound.&nbsp; Mr.
Metcalfe, for the defence, set up the theory of suicide, and the
jury, adopting that view, returned a verdict of not guilty.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;In the House of Commons a motion was agreed to for
the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into alleged
corrupt practices at Norwich at the last election of members to
serve in Parliament.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> August 21st.)</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The Watton and Swaffham Railway Bill was considered
by a Select Committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; The company
asked for powers to extend from Watton in the direction of
Thetford the line of railway constructed between Swaffham and
Watton.&nbsp; The Committee decided that the preamble had been
proved.&nbsp; On June 25th a Select Committee of the House of
Lords ordered the Bill to be reported to that House.&nbsp; The
estimated cost of the construction of the line was &pound;72,500;
the capital proposed to be raised under the Bill was
&pound;80,000&mdash;&pound;62,000 by shares, and the remaining
&pound;20,000 by borrowing powers.&nbsp; The line to Roudham was
opened for passenger traffic on October 18th.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;The Committee appointed by the House of Commons to
investigate the condition of turnpike trusts considered the
affairs of the Norfolk group.&nbsp; The Committee decided that
the New Buckenham, the Norwich, Swaffham, and Mattishall, the
Norwich and Watton, and the Thetford trusts be not continued, and
that the Aylsham and Cromer trusts be continued.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at King&rsquo;s Lynn, Mr. Charles Gill,
&ldquo;the well-known and highly respected lessee and manager of
theatres in the East Anglian district, and talented
comedian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gill had attained the age of 74 years,
and left a daughter with whom he was about to proceed to
Australia.&nbsp; In his earlier days Mr. Gill performed with the
great Kean and many other eminent actors.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Loveday&rsquo;s English Opera Company commenced an
engagement at Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; Mdlle. Mariana and Miss Ella
Collins made their first appearance in Norwich.</p>
<p>&mdash;The hearing of the election petition against the return
of the Hon. Frederick Walpole and Sir E. H. K. Lacon, as members
for North Norfolk, commenced at the Shirehall, Norwich, before
Mr. Justice Blackburn.&nbsp; The nominal petitioner was Mr.
Edward Colman, merchant, of London, who alleged bribery,
treating, undue influence, employment of roughs, illegal payment
of travelling expenses, and, what was a novel feature in election
inquiries, the employment of canvassers.&nbsp; Counsel for the
petitioner were Mr. Serjeant Ballantyne and Mr. <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Littler,
and for the respondents Mr. O&rsquo;Malley, Q.C., Mr. Rodwell,
Q.C., and Mr. Blofeld.&nbsp; The trial concluded on the 24th,
when his lordship, in delivering judgment, said the petition had
completely failed.&nbsp; Both members were duly elected, and in
the present case there was no reason for departing from the rule
that the petitioner must pay the costs.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s birthday was observed in the usual
manner at Norwich.&nbsp; A parade of the Royal Horse Artillery
and the Volunteers took place.&nbsp; The event was officially
observed on June 2nd, when the troops were reviewed on Mousehold;
the Mayor and Mayoress entertained the aged poor at the Corn
Hall, and gave a feast to the inmates of the Workhouse.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The foundation-stone of the new church of St.
James&rsquo;, Yarmouth, was laid by the Dean of Norwich.&nbsp;
The church was partially opened on April 27th, 1870.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;A crane was shot at South Pickenham.&nbsp; It was a
young male, in good condition, measured 64 inches in length, and
weighed 10&frac12; lbs.; the expanse of its wings was 93
inches.&nbsp; On the 12th two were killed out of four seen at
Burnham, and about the same time another was shot on the Thornham
salt marshes.&nbsp; The occurrence of so many cranes in one year
was remarkable, as not more than three or four specimens were
known to have been procured in Norfolk during the preceding half
century.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;A great demonstration was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, Norwich, in opposition to the Irish Church Bill.&nbsp; The
meeting was convened by the Norwich Conservative and
Constitutional Association, and was presided over by Sir Samuel
Bignold.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Lugano, Switzerland, where he had gone for
the benefit of his health, Mr. Charles Cory, Town Clerk of Great
Yarmouth, aged 57.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. Robert Cory,
solicitor, a former Mayor of the borough, and was elected Town
Clerk in 1851, in succession to Mr. J. Clowes.&nbsp; Mr. Charles
Diver was elected to the vacant office on June 21st.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, it
was reported that new governors had been appointed under the
amended Grammar School and Commercial School scheme.&nbsp; The
Town Clerk, it was stated, had obtained for the Corporation the
right of interfering in the trust, and had procured the adoption
of the lists furnished by the Council.&nbsp; The principle
obtained was an important one&mdash;that no body of trustees
exercising a trust for the benefit of the city and neighbourhood
should be allowed to make enormous and various changes in their
government and management of the school, which was the property
of the Council as much as theirs, without the sanction of the
representative body.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The annual show of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association commenced at Attleborough, and was continued on the
25th.&nbsp; The members&rsquo; dinner took place at the Corn
Hall, and was presided over by the Hon. Thomas de Grey, M.P.</p>

<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>7.&mdash;The new dock at Lynn, completed at the cost of
upwards of &pound;80,000, was opened by the Prince of Wales, who
was accompanied by the Princess of Wales.&nbsp; Their Royal
Highnesses arrived by special train from London, and were
received at the railway station by the Chairman of the Dock
Company (Mr. L. W. Jarvis), the Mayor (Mr. J. Thorley), the
members of Parliament for the borough, and others.&nbsp; Escorted
by a troop of the 3rd (Prince of Wales&rsquo;) Dragoons, from
Colchester, the Prince and Princess proceeded to the Town Hall,
where an address was read by the Recorder.&nbsp; After a visit to
the Grammar School, where his Royal Highness presented the medal
annually given by him to the head boy, the procession went to the
Common Staithe Quay, where the twin screw steamer Mary, of
London, was lying ready to receive the party on board.&nbsp; The
band of the Grenadier Guards, under Mr. Dan Godfrey, played a
selection of music as the vessel steamed down the Estuary
Channel.&nbsp; Returning to the harbour, the Mary passed through
the lock gate into the Dock basin, amid the loud cheers of the
spectators, the playing of the National Anthem, and the ringing
of the church bells.&nbsp; His Royal Highness having declared the
Dock duly opened, said that it would thenceforth be called the
Alexandra Dock.&nbsp; The Royal visitors and a distinguished
company next proceeded to the Town Hall for luncheon.&nbsp; The
Prince and Princess afterwards left for Sandringham.&nbsp; In the
evening the town was illuminated, and a display of fireworks was
given in the Tuesday Market Place.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;After lying high and dry for upwards of nine weeks,
the large screw steamer, Lady Flora, was launched from Caister
beach.&nbsp; She was a first-class vessel, of 750 tons register,
and 1,000 tons gross, 205 feet in length, 29 feet beam, and was
valued at &pound;16,000.&nbsp; On May 1st she ran hard and fast
on the beach, in close contiguity to the dangerous shoal known as
the Patch.&nbsp; Early in June the services of Mr. T. B. Carr,
engineer, of Hull, were engaged by the underwriters, and efforts
were made to get her off.&nbsp; The steamer had become embedded
in the sand to the depth of eight feet, but by the aid of very
powerful hydraulic cranes and other appliances, and assisted by
120 men, Mr. Carr succeeded in lifting the vessel four feet above
the beach.&nbsp; In these operations upwards of &pound;2,000 was
expended.&nbsp; Three thousand persons assembled to witness the
launch.&nbsp; When the blocks were knocked away the vessel, by
her own weight, glided broadside off, and rolled in magnificent
style into 4&frac12; feet of water.&nbsp; Her draught (empty) was
eight feet; as the tide rose she floated with it, and was towed
to Hull for repair.&nbsp; On November 20th it was announced that
the Lady Flora, which was then engaged in the Baltic trade, had
been lost at sea.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;In recognition of the great services he had rendered
to the Norwich Battalion of Rifle Volunteers during the five
years it was under his command, Col. Black was presented with a
service of plate by the officers, non-commissioned officers, and
members of the corps.&nbsp; <a name="page193"></a><span

command of the Battalion by Col. G. M. Boileau.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Robertson&rsquo;s comedy, &ldquo;Caste,&rdquo; which
marked a new era in the character of theatrical representation,
was produced for the first time in Norwich, by a company which
appeared at the Theatre Royal, under the management of Mr.
Frederick Younge.&nbsp; The transition from sensational drama and
broad farce to refined comedy was by no means appreciated by
local playgoers, and the attendance during the week was unusually
small even for Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;School&rdquo; was the other
piece performed by the company, which comprised Mr. Frederick
Younge, Mr. Craven, Mr. J. W. Ray, Mr. G. Canninge, Mr. Fortune,
Mrs. E. Dyas, Miss Ada Dyas, and Miss Brunton.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;Died at Saham, Mr. Jonas Silvanus Wright, aged
71.&nbsp; He was the author of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rambles in Wales,&rdquo; and other poems.</p>

serve in Parliament for the city of Norwich commenced its
sittings at the Shirehall, Norwich.&nbsp; The Commissioners were
Mr. George Morley Dowdeswell, Q.C., Mr. Horatio Mansfield, and
Mr. John Biron.&nbsp; On September 4th (the fifteenth day) the
Court adjourned until the 27th, when the inquiry was
resumed.&nbsp; Sir Henry Stracey was examined on October 9th (the
27th day), and Mr. J. H. Tillett on October 11th (the 29th
day).&nbsp; The inquiry terminated on October 15th (the 32nd
day).&nbsp; The Chief Commissioner acknowledged the assistance
given by the police and the Guardians.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
feel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that these bodies have rendered us
most efficient and signal assistance, and we only wish that other
officials in this city had also offered us that assistance, and
that we had not experienced obstacles on their part.&nbsp; We
fear that the encouragement which has been given by them to
persons to withhold information has led to many of those
spectacles which have been to us a source of signal pain in the
course of our inquiry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Commissioners, in their
report, dated February 15th, 1870, stated that corrupt practices
did not extensively prevail in Norwich at the election in
November, 1868; that Sir Henry Stracey was returned through such
practices; and that corrupt practices did not extensively prevail
at the election of 1865 or that of 1860.&nbsp; Several persons
were scheduled for bribery and for corruptly influencing voters
by treating.&nbsp; The Norwich Voters Disfranchisement Bill, by
which it was proposed to disfranchise 119 electors, passed its
second reading in the House of Commons on May 2nd, 1870, and
received the Royal assent on July 4th in the same year.&nbsp;

failure, and the total receipts, about &pound;4,000, barely
covered expenses.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>15.&mdash;A Conservative banquet was held at the Town Hall,
Great Yarmouth, to celebrate the return of the Hon. Frederick
Walpole and Sir E. Lacon, Bart., as members for North
Norfolk.&nbsp; Upwards of 1,000 electors of the Flegg Hundreds

extraordinary and exceptional one, not only as regards the
present season, but also as compared with those of the wonderful
voyage of 1868.&nbsp; The quantities of herring delivered on
Yarmouth fishwharf exceeded 2,400 lasts (13,200 fish per last), a
catch probably unprecedented.&nbsp; Several of the smacks had
&lsquo;made up&rsquo; before the recent successes, being
compelled to do so in consequence of the terrible disasters that
had befallen them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Died in Florida, while on leave of absence from
Montreal, Lieut.-General Sir Charles Ashe Windham, K.C.B.,
commanding the forces in Canada.&nbsp; He was the fourth son of
Vice-Admiral Windham, of Felbrigg Hall, who was the son of the
Rev. George William Lukin, Dean of Wells, and who assumed the
name of Windham on succeeding to the estates of his distinguished
relative, the Right Hon. William Windham.&nbsp; His mother was
Anne, daughter of Mr. Peter Thellusson, of Broadsmouth,
Yorkshire, and sister of the first Baron Rendlesham.&nbsp; He was
born at Felbrigg in 1810, and married first, in 1849, Marianne
Catherine Emily, daughter of Admiral Sir John P. Beresford,
Bart., K.C.B., who died in 1865; and secondly, in 1866, Charlotte
Jane, eldest daughter of the Rev. Henry Des V&oelig;ux.&nbsp;
Educated at Sandhurst, he entered the Army in 1826, as ensign and
lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and served in Canada during
the time of the rebellion, from 1838 to 1842.&nbsp; He continued
with the regiment until the outbreak of the war with Russia, when
he accompanied the Eastern Army as Assistant Quarter-master
General of the 4th Division, and served from September, 1854, to
July, 1856, without a day&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; He was present
at the battle of the Alma, at Balaclava, and at the repulse of
the powerful sortie on October 26th, 1854, and was with Sir
George Cathcart when the latter was killed at the battle of
Inkerman.&nbsp; At the second assault on the Redan, on September
8th, 1855, Windham (then Colonel) greatly distinguished himself
by his personal daring and gallantry in command of the storming
party of the second division, and for his intrepid conduct was
promoted Major-General.&nbsp; In September, 1855, he was
appointed Governor of the British portion of Sebastopol, and in
the following month was entrusted with the command of the 4th
Division.&nbsp; For his services in the Crimea he received

Crimea, in July, 1856, he was enthusiastically received at
Norwich and presented with two handsome swords, purchased by
public subscription.&nbsp; In April, 1857, he was returned to
Parliament for East Norfolk, and remained its member for two
years.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A meeting of the Norwich Diocesan Church Association
was held at the Church Societies&rsquo; Rooms, Norwich, for the
purpose of discussing the question of national education, a
subject which was brought prominently before the country during
this year.&nbsp; The Bishop of Norwich presided, and the Dean
moved, &ldquo;That in any legislative enactments for promoting
the education of the children of the working <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>classes
called for by the destitution in this respect of many places in
England and Wales, the inculcation of Christian truth ought to
form an essential feature, and that provision for this purpose
can be best made under existing circumstances through the medium
of parochial and other schools attached to the Church of England
or to other religious communions.&rdquo;&nbsp; A further
resolution was moved by the Hon. Frederick Walpole, M.P.,
&ldquo;That the present system, which has been successfully in
operation during the last thirty years, carried on by means of
voluntary efforts, and maintained by school fees, charitable
contributions, and grants from the Consolidated Fund, is capable
of further extension and improvement, and is able, if adequately
assisted by the State, to supply the national wants of the
country without resorting to local taxation for the purpose,
unless in those extreme cases for which provision can be made in
no other way.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third resolution was moved by Mr. C.
S. Read, M.P., &ldquo;That compulsory education, except under
especial circumstances, such as the case of vagrant, criminal,
and destitute children, would be an unnecessary interference with
the rights and responsibilities of parents, and unless applied to
all classes of the community, create an unjust and invidious
distinction between rich and poor, and its enforcement by pains
and penalties would cause a general feeling of hardship and
discontent, while its objects could be attained by other means,
such as the extension, under due restrictions, of the Factory
Acts and of similar measures regulating the employment of
children&rsquo;s labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; The final resolution was
moved by the Rev. Canon Heaviside, &ldquo;That in the opinion of
this meeting it is expedient that the promoters of Church
education should consent that in schools aided by the Government
grant provision should be made for securing perfect liberty of
distinctive religious teaching combined with perfect liberty of
declining it.&rdquo;&nbsp; These resolutions were adopted.&nbsp;
The Elementary Education Bill, introduced by Mr. W. E. Forster on
February 17th, was passed, and received the Royal assent on
August 9th.&nbsp; On October 11th a meeting of the clergy was
held, under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. A. F. C.
Bolingbroke), at the Girls&rsquo; Model School, Norwich,
&ldquo;for the purpose of consulting as to the steps to be taken
under the Elementary Education Act,&rdquo; and it was resolved to
convene a public meeting for the discussion of the
question.&nbsp; This meeting was held on October 19th, at the
Free Library, and was composed of &ldquo;school managers and
supporters of Church education.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor again
presided.&nbsp; The Lord Bishop moved, &ldquo;That, with the view
of carrying out the objects of the Elementary Education Act,
1870, in this city, steps be immediately taken to supply and
maintain sufficient, efficient, and suitable schools on the
voluntary principle, in order to secure in Church schools
religious education in accordance with the teaching of the Church
of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was seconded by Mr. Henry
Birkbeck.&nbsp; The Sheriff (Mr. Henry Morgan) moved, &ldquo;That
an immediate appeal be made to the citizens of Norwich to provide
funds on the voluntary principle for carrying out the object of
this meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; A further resolution was adopted,
&ldquo;That the Bishop of the Diocese, with the clergy of the
city, the managers of Church schools, and such donors and
subscribers as may be willing to act be constituted a council,
and shall appoint, as soon as possible, a committee to carry out
the former resolutions, and to report progress to the council
from time to time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The body thus constituted was
afterwards known as <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the Church Education Council.&nbsp;
On November 28th the supporters of voluntary education held a
large meeting at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, at which were adopted
resolutions framed on similar lines to the foregoing.&nbsp; The
supporters of unsectarian education held a meeting at the Free
Library on the 30th, under the presidency of Mr. Jacob Henry
Tillett, at which the Rev. G. S. Barrett moved, &ldquo;That a
request be sent to the Mayor to convene a common hall, in order
that steps may be taken immediately for the formation of a School
Board in the city.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. J. Hallett seconded the
motion, which was unanimously adopted, and a committee was formed
for the purpose of carrying it into effect.&nbsp; The Church
Education Council, on December 13th, announced that sufficient
subscriptions had been obtained for providing necessary school
accommodation in Norwich.&nbsp; At a special meeting of the Town
Council on December 20th, the return made under the provisions of
the Act to the Education Department of the Privy Council was
approved.&nbsp; It stated that the estimated population of the
city was 82,000, the rateable value &pound;212,129; the total
number of assessments, 21,397; and the number of voters on the
municipal register, 10,909.&nbsp; &ldquo;The returns from
elementary schools as being in operation were 93; the number of
schools to which forms were delivered but refused to fill them up
was 27.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 28th, 1871.)</p>

Call&rdquo; commenced in Norwich.&nbsp; A simultaneous and united

<p>31.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Byles,
Robert Hardiment, tanner and fellmonger, was charged on five
counts with bribing voters at the last General Election to vote
for Sir H. J. Stracey.&nbsp; The Attorney-General appeared for
the prosecution, and the defendant was found guilty.&nbsp; His
lordship remarked that this was a very serious crime, and, as he
was desirous that sentence should be pronounced by the highest
judicature of the country, judgment was reserved.&nbsp; Another
person, named Banfather, charged with bribery at the same
election, was acquitted.&nbsp; On April 1st, at the same Court,
John Hughes Hulme was found guilty of bribery, and sentence was
reserved.&nbsp; Edward Stracey, son of Sir Henry J. Stracey, was
next charged.&nbsp; The Attorney-General conducted the case for
the prosecution, and Mr. A. Staveley Hill, Q.C., was specially
retained for the defence.&nbsp; On April 2nd the jury returned a
verdict of not guilty.&nbsp; &ldquo;No sooner was the
announcement made than deafening cheers were raised in the Court,
and it was in vain that the officers tried to suppress
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The defendant Hardiment was indicted, before
Mr. Justice Blackburn, on various counts, for committing acts of
bribery at the Eighth Ward Municipal Election, on November 1st,
1869.&nbsp; On being found guilty, he was sentenced to six
months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; Joseph Stanley, solicitor, was
charged with unlawfully conspiring with Robert Hardiment and
others to induce, by means of bribes, certain persons to vote for
Edward Bennett and George Gedge, candidates at the municipal
election in question.&nbsp; The jury acquitted the
defendant.&nbsp; Anthony Freestone, baker, and Henry Ellis, shoe
manufacturer, were also indicted for conspiring to bribe at the
municipal election, and were acquitted.&nbsp; On April 8th
Messrs. W. H. Tillett and Co., solicitors, addressed a letter to
the newspapers, asserting that &ldquo;the jury drew lots to
decide what their verdict should be in the cases of Freestone and
Ellis.&rdquo;&nbsp; They added, &ldquo;The verdict is, of course,
bad, and we shall feel it our duty to lay the facts before the
committee of gentlemen who instructed us in the
prosecutions.&rdquo;&nbsp; No further action was taken,
however.&nbsp; In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, on May 10th,
before the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Blackburn, Mellor, and
Hannen, Hardiment and Hulme were brought up for sentence.&nbsp;
Mr. Bulwer, Q.C., applied for mitigation of sentence in the case
of Hardiment, on the ground that he was then undergoing
imprisonment for municipal bribery; in the case of Hulme it was
urged that imprisonment would be injurious to his health.&nbsp;
The Court passed sentence of ten months&rsquo; <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>imprisonment upon the first-named defendant, to run
concurrently with the six months he had received for municipal
bribery, two months of which he had already served, to be classed
as a second-class misdemeanant, and to be fined &pound;100.&nbsp;
Hulme was fined &pound;100.&nbsp; Mr. C. S. Read, M.P.,
subsequently presented to the Home Secretary a memorial, signed
by 1,500 citizens, praying that Hardiment should be classed as a
first-class misdemeanant.</p>

name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Robert had
speculated and lost heavily, and having been unable to meet his
engagements, was posted a defaulter on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;
At an early hour on the 16th the following notice was exhibited
upon the closed doors of the Crown Bank: &ldquo;Norwich Crown
Bank.&nbsp; In consequence of the lamentable catastrophe which
has happened to Sir Robert Harvey, it has been determined by the
other partners to suspend the business of the Bank for the
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; This notice gave rise to increased
anxiety.&nbsp; Messrs. Gurneys offered to afford every possible
accommodation to the customers of the Crown Bank, and a few hours
later the National Provincial Bank made a similar offer.&nbsp;
The affairs of the Crown Bank being inextricably involved, Mr.
Allday Kerrison, one of the partners, signed, on the 16th, a
declaration of insolvency, and on the same day the largest city
creditor, Mr. George Gedge, presented a petition for
bankruptcy.&nbsp; The sale of the good-will and premises of the
Bank was provisionally made to Messrs. Gurneys and Co. on the
18th.&nbsp; Mr. Allday Kerrison and his son, gentlemen of
unsullied honour, had their fortunes shattered by one dire
stroke, through the reckless speculations of their partner,
speculations of which they were entirely ignorant.&nbsp; The
inquest was held upon the body of the deceased baronet at Crown
Point on the 20th, by Mr. W. H. N. Turner, one of the Deputy
Coroners for the Liberty of the Dean and Chapter of Norwich, and
the jury returned the following verdict: &ldquo;The jury are of
opinion that Sir Robert Harvey&rsquo;s death was caused by
firearms discharged by himself while in a state of temporary
insanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; A meeting of the principal creditors was
held at the Royal Hotel on the 21st, under the presidency of the
Mayor, and the following resolution was passed: &ldquo;That this
meeting entirely approves of the steps taken by Messrs. Kerrison
in suspending the business of the Bank, the measures taken to
protect the assets of the Bank by the immediate filing of a
petition in bankruptcy and the negotiations for the sale of the
goodwill and the business and premises to Messrs. Gurneys and
Co.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 27th a meeting was held at the Royal
Hotel for the purpose of considering and discussing the best
course to be taken in liquidating the estate of the
bankrupts.&nbsp; Mr. E. C. Bailey was appointed trustee of the
estate, and the Mayor and Messrs. F. E. Watson, H. S. Patteson,
H. Woods, and C. Hornor a committee of inspection.&nbsp; The
first general meeting of creditors was held on August 3rd, when
it was reported that the total liabilities to rank for dividend
would be &pound;1,600,321, and the total assets
&pound;910,187.&nbsp; [Sir Robert John Harvey Harvey was the
eldest son of General Sir Robert John Harvey, C.B., K.T.S., of
Mousehold House, Norwich, by Charlotte (his cousin), daughter and

should be fully represented, for the purpose of considering and
eliciting the opinions of Churchmen upon matters affecting the
Church in general, or our own diocese in particular?&rdquo;&nbsp;

Conference, and the Bishop, considering the large area of the
diocese, decided that the meetings should take place in five
different centres.&nbsp; The first Conference was held at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall on this date; the second at Fakenham Corn
Hall, on November 1st; the third at Ipswich Public Hall, on

fortnight before winter made its appearance in stern reality the
thermometer registered in Norwich 55.&nbsp; On the 21st there

assessment, and of inducing the Government to contribute more
largely to the rates levied under the authority of Courts of

inasmuch as many of the charges at present paid by county rates,
such as police, lunatic asylums, military stores, coroners,
gaols, &amp;c., are rendered necessary not for the benefit of any
particular class or locality, but of the community at large, it
is both just and politic that those charges should be much more
liberally supplemented from the National Exchequer, and that a
petition from Quarter Sessions be presented to the House of
Commons to this effect.&rdquo;&nbsp; The resolution was seconded
by Mr. Dalrymple, M.P., and agreed to.</p>

the Foudroyant, but on the quarterdeck of that vessel saw it

patent) was tested in the streets of Thetford by Messrs. Burrell,

the engine consist of its wheels, three in number, being fitted

wide, covered with steel and kept on the wheels by endless
chains.&nbsp; The great use of these indiarubber tyres is to give
elasticity.&rdquo;</p>

of the report, which was seconded by Mr. Youngs.&nbsp; Mr. Priest

distinctive character to the gathering, and the whole of the
arrangements were carried out by a committee of

display of fireworks on the Castle Meadow.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;Captain Bates, the Kentucky Giant, and
Chrissie-Millie, better known as the &ldquo;Two-headed
Nightingale,&rdquo; appeared at the Lecture Hall, St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, Norwich.&nbsp; Of this mulatto girl it was said,
&ldquo;Chrissie and Millie are fairly educated, and sing either
solos or duets with ease and effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Died at Naples, the Right Hon. Henry Lytton Earle
Bulwer, Baron Dalling and Bulwer.&nbsp; Born in 1804, his
lordship was the second son of General William Bulwer, of Heydon
Hall and Wood Dalling, by Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, sole heiress
and last descendant of the Lyttons of Knebworth in
Hertfordshire.&nbsp; His career as a diplomatist is familiar to
every student of history.&nbsp; His lordship was the author of
&ldquo;Historical Characters,&rdquo; which appeared in two
volumes in the winter of 1867, and rapidly ran into a sixth
edition; and of a &ldquo;Life of Lord Palmerston,&rdquo;
published in 1871.&nbsp; The remains of the deceased nobleman
were interred at Heydon on June 25th.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A one hundred yards&rsquo; race took place on the
West Winch Road, Lynn, between Thomas Akers and a horse belonging
to Mr. W. L. Proctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Akers led off, the horse not
starting directly the signal was given, but he had not proceeded
far when he was overtaken by the animal and beaten by about ten
yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>29.&mdash;The tower of the church of Beeston-next-Mileham was
struck by lightning.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Litcham fire-engine was
taken into the church, but the molten lead and burning timber
fell so rapidly that nothing could be done, and the tower was
entirely destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A remarkable mirage was witnessed at Yarmouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The weather was exceedingly sultry, with heavy banks of
clouds towards the east and south-east, just opposite Yarmouth,
and extending from the Scroby to the Corton Sands there appeared
a sharply-defined and magnificent outline of Gorleston and Corton
cliff, with the entrance to the harbour and even the white
sands.&nbsp; A stranger visiting the locality for the first time
would have supposed that Yarmouth was embayed by a narrow
peninsula.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;Mr. G. B. Loveday&rsquo;s Gaiety Operetta Company,
under the direction of Mr. John Hollingshead, appeared at Norwich
Theatre.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The Prince of Wales visited Yarmouth for the first
time.&nbsp; His Royal Highness, accompanied by the Earl of
Leicester, arrived at Southtown station, and was received by the
Mayor (Mr. E. H. L. Preston), the members of the Corporation, and
the Recorder (Mr. Simms Reeve), who read an address of
welcome.&nbsp; The Militia Artillery and the Rifle Volunteers
formed guards of honour, and the Royal carriage was escorted from
the station to the Town Hall, by the 7th Dragoon Guards from
Norwich, under the command of Colonel Peyton.&nbsp; <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>After

newly-erected Grammar School, at the junction of Trafalgar Road
and Apsley Road, and declared the buildings open; in the evening
he dined at the Artillery mess and attended a performance in
which Mr. Toole appeared, at the Regent Hall.&nbsp; On the 7th
the Prince was present at a review of the Artillery Militia, of
which he was honorary colonel, and on the 8th returned by special
train to London.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Mr. J. L. Toole and Miss E. Farren appeared at
Norwich Theatre on this and the succeeding evening in
&ldquo;Dearer than Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Steeplechase,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Weavers,&rdquo; scenes from &ldquo;Paul Pry,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Ici on parle Fran&ccedil;ais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The show of the Norfolk Agricultural Association, of
which the Prince of Wales was this year President, commenced at
King&rsquo;s Lynn, and was attended by his Royal Highness, who
was accompanied by the Princess of Wales.&nbsp; The Prince

<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died at the Roman Catholic Presbytery, Willow Lane,
Norwich, the Rev. Edmund Costello, S.J., aged 44.&nbsp; Father
Costello had been in ill-health, and his death was accelerated by
his devoted ministrations among the poor when the small-pox
epidemic was at its height.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. James
Costello, of Eyre Square, Galway, was educated at the Irish
College, Paris, at Maynooth, and at Stonyhurst, and entered upon
the Norwich Roman Catholic Mission in 1868.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The 3rd Norfolk Rifle Volunteers (formerly the 1st
Administrative Battalion), commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Duff, went
into camp at Ketteringham Park.&nbsp; The North Walsham corps
marched from that town to the camp, a distance of twenty-two
miles.&nbsp; The 2nd Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel R. T.
Gurdon, was brigaded with the 3rd Battalion.&nbsp; The camp was

<p>29.&mdash;The sale of Crown Point and Whitlingham estate took
place at the Royal Hotel, Norwich, by order of the Court of

Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, by the Conservatives of the city,
with a valuable piece of plate, as &ldquo;a mark of their
appreciation of his political conduct during the recent contests,
and their admiration of his example as a straightforward English
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Stracey received from the ladies of
Norwich a diamond bracelet, and silver bouquet-holders were
presented by working-men to the Misses Stracey.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The High Sheriff (Mr. Angerstein) was fined &pound;50
by the Judge <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>of Assize at Norwich.&nbsp; (Mr. Justice Keating), for
non-attendance with his carriage at the Judge&rsquo;s
lodgings.&nbsp; His lordship had driven to the court in a cab,
which he considered to be &ldquo;a way not fitting her
Majesty&rsquo;s Judges.&rdquo;&nbsp; The High Sheriff
subsequently explained that a mistake had been made as to the
time fixed for the sitting of the court, and having tendered an
apology, the fine was remitted by his lordship.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Byles,
James Johnson, of North Walsham, sought to recover from Mr. W. H.
Cooke, Q.C., Judge of the Norfolk County Court, damages for false
imprisonment and assault.&nbsp; It was alleged that the defendant
wrongfully imprisoned the plaintiff for thirty days; when the
plaintiff left Norwich Castle he personally served the Judge, as
he was leaving the court, with a notice of action for false
imprisonment, and his Honour, mistaking the man&rsquo;s
intention, seized him by the collar, and a second time ordered
his arrest.&nbsp; For the defendant it was alleged that he had
acted within his jurisdiction.&nbsp; After two days&rsquo; trial
the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages one
farthing.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;An alarming flood occurred at Walsingham.&nbsp; Owing
to heavy rains, the stream in the vicinity overflowed its banks,
and the low-lying part of the town was submerged.&nbsp; Forty
women and children were rescued from the upper rooms of the
cottages by means of ladders, and conveyed in boats to a place of
safety.&nbsp; On the 9th a temporary dam was erected, which had
the effect of diverting the flow of water.&nbsp; The village of
East Barsham was also flooded, and the high road at West Barsham
was under water.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norfolk Central Committee, held
at the Shirehall, Norwich, it was reported that foot-and-mouth
disease had spread to an alarming extent among cattle and
sheep.&nbsp; On the motion of Mr. C. S. Read, M.P., it was
ordered that markets for fat stock be held under the same
restrictions that were in force during the time of the cattle
plague, and that similar regulations should govern the movements
of store stock as were then in force.&nbsp; In Norfolk alone
during the previous five weeks the loss to stockowners from
foot-and-mouth disease was estimated at &pound;22,500, in respect
of 10,000 cattle and 5,000 sheep.&nbsp; The committee sent a
memorial to the Privy Council to prohibit the opening of all
fairs and markets for the period of six weeks.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died suddenly, at Hills Road, Cambridge, Mr. George
Kett.&nbsp; He was born at Suton, near Wymondham, on June 26th,
1809, and commenced life in a small way of business as a wood
carver at Wymondham.&nbsp; After copying poppyheads at Wymondham
church, he undertook the carving of the seats for Ketteringham
and Mulbarton churches.&nbsp; He then removed to Norwich, where
he was engaged upon the restoration of the Cathedral stalls and
canopies.&nbsp; Whilst he was working there Mr. James Rattee was
placed under him as an apprentice, and the two afterwards became
partners.&nbsp; Mr. Kett was next offered employment upon the
works for the new Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; In 1845 he removed
to London, where he was principally employed under the immediate
direction of Sir Charles Barry, in supplying designs for the wood
carving.&nbsp; Among other portions of the work on which he was
specially engaged were the Royal Arms at the back of the Throne
in the House of Lords.&nbsp; Mr. Rattee, in 1848, consulted him
<a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>upon an
estimate for the restoration of the choir of Ely Cathedral, and
Mr. Kett agreed that if the tender were accepted he would remove
to Cambridge and assist him in carrying it out.&nbsp; The
business partnership thus commenced continued after Mr.
Rattee&rsquo;s death, in 1854, with his widow, under the style of
Rattee and Kett.&nbsp; Mrs. Rattee died in 1866, when Mr. Kett
assumed sole control of the establishment, and was largely
engaged in the work of church restoration in all parts of the
United Kingdom.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died at Felbrigg Park, Mr. John Ketton, in his 61st
year.&nbsp; Mr. Ketton was a native of Norwich, where for many
years he was engaged in commercial pursuits.&nbsp; His success
enabled him, when Mr. Windham&rsquo;s affairs became embarrassed,
to purchase the Felbrigg estate, where he resided until the
period of his death.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at Reigate, Surrey, from the effects of injuries
inflicted upon himself, Mr. Benjamin Land, better known as
&ldquo;Ben Land,&rdquo; a sporting character of great celebrity
in his day.&nbsp; Mr. Land began life as a Norfolk farmer, and
gave great encouragement to steeple-chasing in the county, upon
the introduction of that sport in the first half of the
century.&nbsp; One of his earliest winning mounts was in 1836, a
horse named Predictor.&nbsp; Then he owned a very useful nag
called Neewood, and another, Lottery, an exceedingly clever
animal over a country.&nbsp; Land made himself further known by
his doings on Jim Crow, Faith, the Novice, Yellow Dwarf, Little
Nell, Victoria, and Wonder, who could all run and jump a bit, and
sad teasers they were to other Norfolk sportsmen.&nbsp; While
still holding on his farm, Land hunted a pack of staghounds, but
he gradually got out of business as an agriculturist, and took to
riding and training as a profession.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The provisions of the new Licensing Act came into
operation in Norwich.&nbsp; A notice had been issued by the Chief
Constable that on Sunday, Christmas-day, and Good Friday,
licensed houses were not to open before 12.30 at noon and to
close at 2.30 in the afternoon; not to open again before six in
the evening, and to close at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; On
week-days they were not to open until six in the morning, and to
close at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
application of the Act came on the city suddenly and
unexpectedly, the general opinion having prevailed that
everything would go on as usual until the next annual
licensing-day.&nbsp; In Union Place and King Street many people
determined to have their own way as far as they could, and
accordingly just before closing time they made a great demand
upon the can accommodation of the houses.&nbsp; Large cans and
small cans, when filled with beer, were borne off in triumphant
defiance to the pavement outside, or to the men&rsquo;s private
gardens or houses, where friend and neighbour remained drinking,
and, in some cases, singing, together long after the lights of
the various public-houses had been extinguished.&nbsp; In two or
three instances some ill-advised publicans persisted in keeping
their houses open.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several licensed victuallers were
fined for infringing the regulations of the new Act, and in the
early days of its operation the Norwich magistrates were very
liberal in granting extensions of time on the occasion of the
Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun holidays.&nbsp; At East Dereham
the justices permitted the public-houses to remain open until
twelve o&rsquo;clock during four months of the year.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The first really notable journey upon a bicycle was
performed <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>by Percy Everett, of Ryburgh, a lad aged 16.&nbsp; He
started at 4.45 a.m. from Ryburgh station, and rode to Newmarket,
where he had breakfast; thence to Whittlesford, where he lunched;
and at 5.30 p.m. he reached Ware, in Hertfordshire, having
accomplished the distance of 110 miles in about 12&frac12;
hours.&nbsp; Everett rode one of the first of the rubber-tyred
bicycles&mdash;a machine of Coventry make, known as the
&ldquo;Aeriel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Died, Mr. Edmund Harbord Lushington Preston, Mayor
of Great Yarmouth.&nbsp; Mr. Preston was born in 1806, at the
period when the Hon. E. Harbord (second son of the then Lord
Suffield) and Mr. Stephen Lushington were returned to Parliament
as members for Yarmouth&mdash;hence two of his Christian
names.&nbsp; After the passing of the Municipal Reform Act, he
was one of the first burgesses returned to the Town Council on
Conservative principles, and, with the exception of a short
period, from November, 1868, to November, 1869, he continued to
be a member of the Corporation.&nbsp; Mr. Preston was for twenty
years one of the magistrates of the borough, and a member of the
Port and Haven Commission.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The Blake-Bignold incident occurred at the Norwich
Police-court.&nbsp; Mr. Blake, on September 2nd, was charged with
assaulting a publican, and fined, and, on his leaving the court,
was followed by a mob, who endeavoured to overturn the cab in
which he had taken refuge.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Lord Walsingham, while shooting on Blubberhouse
Moor, Yorkshire, killed with his own gun 842 head of grouse,
between the hours of 5.30 a.m. and 3 p.m.&nbsp; The birds were
driven, and before one o&rsquo;clock 550 had been bagged.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A portion of the Reserve Squadron, consisting of
nine ironclad war vessels, under the command of Admiral Randolph,
entered Yarmouth Roads, and sailed on the 30th for the
Nore.&nbsp; The officers and men numbered 4,500.</p>
<p>&mdash;A 300 yards swimming match took place at Thorpe,
between John Morris, ex-champion of England, and &ldquo;Victor
Natator, the champion under-water performer,&rdquo; for &pound;10
a side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Natator&rdquo; received ten yards&rsquo;
start, and, after an exciting race, was beaten by three
yards.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died at Slough, Buckinghamshire, aged 95 years, Mrs.
Anne Rigby, widow of Dr. Rigby, of Norwich, whom she survived 51
years.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;The Norwich Board of Guardians, after a long and
acrimonious discussion, agreed, on the motion of the Rev. A. C.
Copeman, seconded by Dr. Bateman, to accede to the request of
Professor Humphrey, of Cambridge, that he be supplied, for the
purposes of dissection, with the unclaimed bodies of persons who
died in the Workhouse.&nbsp; At a meeting on October 3rd an
attempt was made to rescind the resolution, which, however, was
confirmed by 16 votes against 12.&nbsp; On December 12th a third
debate resulted in the rescission of the original motion by one
vote.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The first election in the Eastern Counties under the
new Ballot Act took place at Great Yarmouth, when a councillor

the death of Mr. Preston.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Lord Walsingham was presented by his Merton tenantry
with an address of welcome upon his return after a prolonged
visit to America.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened for the winter season,
under the management of Mr. G. H. Chaplin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has
been our lot to witness some very indifferent acting upon the
Norwich boards, but we never remember having seen a whole company
(with the exception of Mr. Chaplin) so thoroughly destitute of
histrionic talent, or so wretchedly poor in the dresses whereby
to represent the characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Musical Festival
commenced with an evening performance of the &ldquo;Festival Te
Deum&rdquo; (composed in celebration of the recovery of the
Prince of Wales) and of &ldquo;The Creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
morning performance on the 18th was &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo; on the
19th &ldquo;St. Peter&rdquo; (first time of performance in
Norwich); and on the 20th &ldquo;The Messiah.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
evening of the 17th a grand ballad concert took place, and on the

their wedding tour.&nbsp; The squire was presented by the
tenantry with an illuminated address.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died, Mr. John Longe, of Spixworth Park.&nbsp; He
was the second son of the Rev. John Longe, vicar of Coddenham,
Suffolk.&nbsp; Educated at Norwich Grammar School, under Valpy,
and subsequently at Cambridge, he succeeded to the estate in
1828, on the death of the widow of his cousin, Mr. Francis Longe,
who was High Sheriff in 1786.&nbsp; He married, in 1829, Caroline
Elizabeth, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Lieut.-Colonel
Warnford, of Warnford Place, Wilts., and niece of Henry, fourth
Viscount Ashbrook.&nbsp; As a Valpeian, Mr. Longe always took the
greatest interest in the success of the Norwich Grammar School,
of which he was a governor.&nbsp; He was a Deputy-Lieutenant of
the county, and for some years captain in the East Norfolk
Militia, and was succeeded in his estates by his brother, the
Rev. Robert Longe, vicar of Coddenham, who was born in 1800.</p>
<p>&mdash;A heavy gale prevailed off the East coast, and many
shipping casualties were reported.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Died at his seat, Melton Constable, the Right Hon.
and Rev. Delaval Loftus, ninth Baron Hastings, in his 48th
year.&nbsp; His lordship had been summoned from Wiesbaden, in
consequence of the alarming illness of Lady Hastings.&nbsp; He
was at the time recovering from a severe attack of gout, and
little fitted to undertake a long journey.&nbsp; On reaching
Melton Constable he was seized with an illness which proved
fatal.&nbsp; Lord Hastings was educated at Trinity College,
Cambridge, and, on taking holy orders, was appointed to the
family living of Foulsham, and subsequently to that of East
Barsham and Little Snoring.&nbsp; He married, in 1848, the Hon.
Frances Diana Manners Sutton, daughter of the first Viscount
Canterbury, by whom he left <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>three sons and a daughter, and
succeeded to the title and estates on the death of his brother,
in March, 1871.&nbsp; His successor was the Hon. Bernan Edward

<p>&mdash;Died at his residence, Cambridge House,
Westling-on-Trym, Bristol, in his 77th year, the Rev. William
Charles Wollaston, for upwards of thirty years rector of East
Dereham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Wollaston was the thirty-seventh and
last of the sinecure rectors of Dereham, and the exceptional
custom of tolling the muffled bell, which had long been held in
this parish when any of its rectors or vicars died, was
observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The ceremony of laying the first rail of the East
Suffolk Tramway was performed at Yarmouth by Sir E. H. K. Lacon,
M.P. for North Norfolk.&nbsp; As originally planned, the tramway
was to extend from Southtown Railway station to Gorleston, and
thence to Lowestoft and Southwold, and eventually to form a
junction with Halesworth.&nbsp; On March 22nd, 1873, it was
announced: &ldquo;From present appearances, it would seem that
the East Suffolk Tramway scheme has been abandoned.&nbsp; The
works have been wholly stopped for months past, and the Southtown
Road has been restored to its former state.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> April 1st, 1875.)</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At a meeting of the Governors of the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital, the thanks of the Board were accorded to Mr.
William Peter Nichols &ldquo;for his able, humane, and successful
services as surgeon to the charity during the last 21 years, and
for the active and zealous part he has taken during the same
period in promoting the general interests of the
Hospital.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Nichols afterwards became honorary
consulting surgeon to the institution, and on March 22nd, 1873,

the city dated back more than three centuries, and who during
nearly two centuries were extensive brewers in King Street.&nbsp;
Messrs. Morgan, in 1846, purchased the business of Mr.
Kett-Tompson and his brother, their landed property in the county
rendering it unnecessary for them to continue the brewery.&nbsp;

was placed in quarantine.&nbsp; The young lieutenant throughout a
period of the greatest difficulty discharged his duties with
conspicuous success.&nbsp; In 1830 he exchanged into the 1st
Royals (afterwards the Royal Scots), and served in one or other
of the battalions of that regiment for thirty-one years.&nbsp; He
passed through the Canadian Rebellion in 1837, was present at the
affairs of St. Charles and St. Eustache, and returned to England
in 1841.&nbsp; In the Crimea, as commandant at Balaclava, his
duties were so arduous that when he left, completely broken down
in health, in January, 1855, the work was divided among three
officers.&nbsp; In the absence of the colonel he brought the
regiment to Aldershot, and afterwards had the honour of dining
with her Majesty, to whom he was presented by the Prince

<p>11.&mdash;A Local Government Board inquiry was held at the
Guildhall, Norwich, by Mr. R. Morgan, C.E., as to an application
made by the Town Council to borrow the sum of &pound;32,500, for
the purchase of a portion of the Crown Point estate, for sewerage

the Norwich Ratepayers&rsquo; Protection League.&nbsp; Another
phase of the sewerage question occupied the attention of the Town
Council at a special meeting on May 13th, when the City Engineer
presented a report stating that serious defects existed in the
low-level sewer, and part of the works had given way.&nbsp; It
was resolved to borrow &pound;20,000, at four per cent., on

resident in the district of the Wayland Agricultural Association
was held at Watton, under the presidency of Lord Walsingham, when
resolutions were adopted whereby the meeting pledged itself to
decline to recognise the system of compulsion exercised by the
Labourers&rsquo; Union, and to refuse any demand for higher wages
made by those who were members of the Union, &ldquo;although
willing to give favourable consideration to any request made in a
proper manner whenever circumstances might be found to justify
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was further decided to invite co-operation
from a larger area, and to form a society to be called the
Wayland Farmers&rsquo; Defensive Association.&nbsp; Similar
action was taken by employers in the North Walsham district, at

circuit under the management of the Fisher family, no member had
visited it until Mr. David Fisher, now of the London theatres,
and known to us first as a boy actor with his father and
grandfather, came to read &lsquo;The School for
Scandal.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. David Fisher in London has carried out
the promise of his early life, and in coming upon scenes of his
boyhood finds those who tell him tales of former years, and
pleasure no doubt arises on the other side from the opening up of
old associations.&nbsp; We have spoken of Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s
reading&mdash;he does not read, he acts two-thirds of the whole
play from memory; every character is given with perfect

and on his return published a work on &ldquo;The Climate of
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the invitation of the Liberal electors of
Bath, he, in 1868, contested the representation of that city, and
was returned.&nbsp; His chief Parliamentary labours were most
conspicuous in connection with his well-known Habitual Drunkards
Bill, a measure which, while not in accordance with the spirit of
English legislation, evinced that devotion to philanthropic
objects which was the characteristic of Dr. Dalrymple&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; He served the office of Sheriff of Norwich in
1860&ndash;61, was a director of the Norwich Union Fire Office,
chairman of the Governors of King Edward VI. School, and at
various times had taken part in the management of the local
charitable and scientific institutions.&nbsp; Dr. Dalrymple was a

artist.&nbsp; He was born at Saxmundham, in June, 1814, and,
after serving his apprenticeship to a chemist and druggist at
Woodbridge, removed to Norwich, where he acted as dispenser to
the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; An acquaintance with
Crome, Cotman, the elder Ladbrooke, Stark, Vincent, and others of
the Norwich School of Artists, stimulated him to work with his
pencil.&nbsp; Proceeding to London, he devoted himself entirely
to art, and, by teaching drawing and painting, realised nearly
&pound;2,000 a year from that branch of his profession.&nbsp; For
splendid sky effects Bright is second only to Turner, and his
crayon drawings are almost unequalled.</p>

pocket.&nbsp; He offered his services as an assistant in a

inst., ostensibly for the purpose of taking a holiday; but it was
afterwards discovered that he had committed defalcations to the
amount of about &pound;5,000.&nbsp; A committee was appointed to
consider the best course to be adopted, and soon afterwards a
petition was presented for the winding-up of the society, and a
warrant issued for the apprehension of Buttifant.&nbsp; On July
6th William Frederick Fish, a clerk in the employment of
Buttifant, was taken into custody, on the information of Samuel
Beckett Hook, a shareholder in the society, on the charge of

inhabitants of the Hundreds of Tunstead, North Erpingham,
Happing, and East and West Flegg.&nbsp; The school gradually
decayed until only the head-master remained.&nbsp; In 1871 Mr.
Robert Wortley called attention to the fact that the endowment
was lying perfectly useless; an appeal was made to the Endowed

Council on Education adapted a scheme for the management of the
school.&nbsp; New governors were appointed, with Lord Suffield as
president, the school house and master&rsquo;s house were

with completing the feat of walking, at the Hoppole Gardens,
Norwich, one thousand miles in one thousand hours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Although the greatest vigilance has been exercised,&rdquo;
says the report, &ldquo;it has not yet transpired that she has
ever failed to come to the scratch at the appointed times.&nbsp;
During the last week she showed signs of flagging, her limbs
swelling, and considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping
her awake.&nbsp; It was announced that she would walk the last
mile with her infant baby in her arms, but it was evident from
her appearance that this would be too much for her, and her
infant was handed to her when she had only four laps to
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Keating,
Frederick Sutton, formerly medical-officer of the Norwich Pauper

<p>7.&mdash;Mr. J. R. Bulwer, Q.C., M.P., and Mr. William Graham,
Crown Commissioners, opened an inquiry at the Royal Hotel,
Norwich, into the circumstances of what was known as the Creak
case (<i>q.v.</i> Vol. I., p. 485; Vol. II., p. 18).&nbsp; A
special jury was empanelled.&nbsp; Miss Margaret Creak was an
eccentric person, who died in 1850.&nbsp; It transpired at the
trial of certain actions brought in 1866 by Mr. Kent, solicitor,
that the deceased&rsquo;s property in the parishes of St. Andrew
and St. George Colegate had been purchased by Margaret
Creak&rsquo;s mother during her widowhood.&nbsp; Margaret Creak
having died without leaving legal heirs, it was held that her
property devolved upon the Crown, for a strange will made by her
had been decided to be void and of no effect.&nbsp; Since her
death the property had been held by different individuals, some
of whom had exercised the rights and enjoyed the profits of
landlord, whilst others had lived upon the property rent
free.&nbsp; The Crown, on being informed of these facts, issued a
Commission under the Great Seal to ascertain (1) what <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>property
Margaret Creak possessed at the time of her death, and (2) what
had become of her brothers and sisters.&nbsp; The jury, on the
8th, found that Margaret Creak was seised of the fee simple of
three lots of property; that she left no heir thereto; that the
property was of the yearly value of &pound;330 at the time of her
death; and that as the property was holden of the Crown in common
socage, it devolved to her Majesty, in virtue of her prerogative
Royal.&nbsp; The jury further said that mesne profits amounting
to &pound;7,920 had accrued since the death of Margaret Creak, of
which about &pound;2,000 had been received by Jonathan Flowers,
of Gressenhall, and various sums by other persons.&nbsp; The
Commissioners thereupon seized the property into the hands of her
Majesty, and ordered the inquisition to be returned to the Court
of Chancery.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> July 24th, 1876.)</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The forty-second annual meeting of the British
Medical Association commenced at Norwich, under the presidency of
Sir William Fergusson, Bart., Serjeant Surgeon to the
Queen.&nbsp; The President-elect was Dr. Edward Copeman.&nbsp;
During the proceedings, which concluded on the 14th, addresses
were delivered by Sir James Paget, Dr. Eade, Mr. Cadge,
&amp;c.&nbsp; A prominent feature of the visit was an exhibition
at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall of the works of deceased and living
Norfolk and Suffolk artists.&nbsp; This remarkable collection
included examples by Old Crome and his sons, Stannard, Stark, the
Cotmans, Thirtle, Opie, Vincent, Colkett, and others.&nbsp;

<p>12.&mdash;The 7th Hussars arrived at Norwich.&nbsp; The Duke
of Connaught was an officer of the regiment, and his Royal

Lieut.-Colonel Hale and the officers were received by the Mayor
(Mr. S. Gurney Buxton), the Sheriff (Mr. A. R. Chamberlin), the
Deputy-Mayor (Sir Samuel Bignold), the magistrates, and members

Whitlingham, at which addresses were delivered by Mr. J. J.
Colman, M.P., Mr. Henry Birkbeck, Mr. J. H. Tillett, and other

<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>10.&mdash;A terrible railway collision occurred at
Thorpe.&nbsp; The mail train leaving Yarmouth at 8.46 p.m. was
joined at Reedham by another train from Lowestoft.&nbsp; The
combined train proceeded to Brundall, where, owing to the
existence of only a single line, it had to wait until the arrival
of the express train from Norwich to Yarmouth, or until
permission should be given to the engine-driver to proceed.&nbsp;
The accident was caused by the down express being allowed to
leave Norwich while the mail train was permitted to come on from
Brundall.&nbsp; The telegraphic message to Brundall, which had
been written by Night-Inspector Alfred Cooper, but not signed,
was sent through some mistake by the telegraph clerk, John
Robson.&nbsp; A few minutes later the inspector, not knowing that
the message had gone, allowed the down express to proceed.&nbsp;
Hardly had he done so when the fatal <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>error was discovered.&nbsp; A second
message was immediately dispatched to Brundall to stop the mail,
if possible, but the answer came back, &ldquo;Mail gone,&rdquo;
and nothing remained but to make arrangements for dealing with
the inevitable catastrophe.&nbsp; Both drivers had reason for
putting on increased speed, believing, as they did, that each
train was waiting for the other.&nbsp; The speed of the up mail,
which consisted of thirteen carriages, was from thirty to
thirty-five miles an hour, while the rate of the down express of
fourteen carriages was from twenty to twenty-five miles.&nbsp;
The trains met near Thorpe village, the impact producing a
terrific crash which resembled a peal of thunder.&nbsp; The
drivers and firemen of the locomotives were killed, eighteen
passengers were killed on the spot, and about fifty were severely
wounded, of whom five died in the course of a few days, making a
total of twenty-five killed.&nbsp; The dead and dying were
removed to Field&rsquo;s boathouse and to the Tuns Inn, and the
injured were taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; On
the following morning the scene of the catastrophe was visited by
many hundreds of persons, among whom was the Duke of Connaught,
then stationed in Norwich with his regiment, the 7th
Hussars.&nbsp; The City Coroner (Mr. E. S. Bignold) opened an
inquest on the bodies of two persons who had died at Thorpe
station, and, after formal evidence, adjourned the inquiry to the
25th, when the jury found that the accident was due to the
negligence of Robson and Cooper, against whom they returned a
verdict of manslaughter.&nbsp; The County Coroner (Mr. E. Press),
on the 12th, held an inquest on the bodies lying at Thorpe, and
adjourned the inquiry to the Shirehall.&nbsp; On October 5th the
jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against Robson
only.&nbsp; The Board of Trade inquiry commenced at the
Guildhall, before Capt. Tyler, R.E., and Mr. Ravenhill, on
September 21st, and on the 22nd was adjourned <i>sine
die</i>.&nbsp; It was resumed on October 5th, and again
adjourned.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 23rd, 1875.)</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Madame C. Nilsson, assisted by Madame Patey, Mr. E.

<p>17.&mdash;The memorial stone of the Norwich Presbyterian
church was laid by Mr. C. E. Lewis, M.P., and at a public meeting
subsequently held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall an address was
delivered by the Rev. Dr. Chalmers, of London.&nbsp; The
estimated cost of the church was &pound;3,600.&nbsp; It was
designed by Mr. Edward Boardman, architect, of Norwich, and built
by Mr. Samuel Hall.&nbsp; Efforts to establish a Presbyterian
church in the city were made in 1866, when a
&ldquo;station&rdquo; was opened and meetings for worship were
held at the Lecture Hall in St. Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A communion
was formed, and in 1867 St. Peter&rsquo;s Hall, Theatre Street,
was purchased by the congregation.&nbsp; The church, which is
built upon a site adjoining the hall, was opened for public
worship on June 23rd, 1875, by the Rev. John Matheson, the
Moderator, and the Rev. Dr. Fraser.</p>

association, with a testimonial of the value of &pound;50.</p>

Radstock.&nbsp; On the death of his father, Admiral Sir William
Beauchamp Proctor, third baronet, he succeeded to the baronetcy
in 1861.&nbsp; A Liberal in politics, Sir Thomas consented, at
the request of the party, to contest the representation of the
Eastern Division of the county in 1865, in conjunction with
Colonel Coke, but was unsuccessful.&nbsp; Upon the commencement
of the Volunteer movement, he gave it his active support, and was
for some years Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Administrative
Battalion.&nbsp; He served the office of High Sheriff in
1869&ndash;70, and was a Deputy-Lieutenant and magistrate of the
county.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was a warm supporter of local charities,

articles with Mr. Crabtree, at Halesworth, he was admitted an
attorney and solicitor in 1825, and commenced practice in Norwich
and Bungay, in partnership with Mr. J. C. Copeman.&nbsp; In
politics Mr. Freestone was a Liberal, but systematically declined

<p>23.&mdash;Died at Chapel Field Road, Norwich, Mr. Henry
Ninham, aged 82.&nbsp; He was the son of John Ninham, who, in
1792, at the request of Mr. William Stevenson, F.S.A., drew, with
the assistance of the <i>camera obscura</i>, the ancient gates of
Norwich, then about to be demolished.&nbsp; He succeeded to his
father&rsquo;s business as an heraldic painter and copper-plate
printer, and was for many years employed by the principal
coachbuilders of the city to paint armorial bearings on their
patrons&rsquo; carnages.&nbsp; A few days prior to his death, he
completed, for the Very Rev. Dr. Goulburn, a large painting of
the arms of the Deans of Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Ninham was a frequent
contributor to the Norwich exhibitions, both in oil and
water-colours, and made many careful and truthful delineations of
picturesque old houses and churches in the city and its
neighbourhood.&nbsp; A good etcher, he published (without
letterpress) &ldquo;Eight Etchings of Antiquities of
Norwich,&rdquo; including the Strangers&rsquo; Hall, Sir Benjamin
Wrenche&rsquo;s Court, &amp;c.; and afterwards &ldquo;Views of
the Gates of Norwich,&rdquo; from drawings made by Kirkpatrick
about the year 1720.&nbsp; For private circulation only, he
etched a series of small but spirited plates, principally views
in Norwich and Norfolk.&nbsp; The illustrations of Bloom&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Castle Acre,&rdquo; and Grigor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eastern

of Carthage&rdquo; in &ldquo;Burns&rsquo;s Englishman&rsquo;s
Library.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon afterwards, his mind, unhappily,
became clouded, and his services were lost to the Church for over
twenty years.&nbsp; When at length a surprising recovery restored
him to his friends, he returned to the study of theology and the
arts with a vigour and perseverance that would have been
remarkable in a young man of unbroken health.&nbsp; In his youth
Mr. Wilson was no mean poet, and his unpublished verses received
the warm praise of Wordsworth.&nbsp; <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>He had, too, the makings of a great
painter, and some of his best efforts in colouring were executed
only a few weeks before his death.&nbsp; Mr. Wilson was brother
of Sir Archdale Wilson, Bart., of Delhi, and first cousin to
Henry Wilson, Lord Berners, at whose decease the barony, one of
the oldest in England, passed, through an heiress, into another
name.&nbsp; The family was descended from Bourchier, Lord
Berners, the translator of Froissart, and through him from
Bourchier, the Earl of Essex and his wife, a granddaughter of
Edward III.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at Lynn, Mr. F. Reynolds, formerly of Newton
next Castleacre, at an advanced age, and in very reduced
circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deceased for many years was known
by the sobriquet of &lsquo;The Marquis,&rsquo; which was given
him when he kept a pack of harriers at his own expense, and with
which he had good sport.&nbsp; Once in pursuit of a stolen horse,
for a neighbour, he drove one of his hunters, a bay blood horse,
100 miles in ten hours, only stopping once, namely, at Six Mile
Bottom, near Newmarket, where he gave his horse some corn from
his own bag, and fetched him water in his hat from a brook.&nbsp;
One of his first, and, perhaps, best hunters, that he trained to
such perfection, was a bay thoroughbred mare by Old Whisker, bred
by Chifney, the celebrated jockey.&nbsp; She became a
distinguished hunter with the Marham Staghounds.&nbsp; For Chip
he gave but &pound;8, and this horse was afterwards sold by Mr.
Anderson for 500 guineas.&nbsp; Grey Tail, too, was sold by Mr.
Taylor for 400 guineas, and Sweep, bought for &pound;10, was sold
by Mr. Percival for 300 guineas; whilst poor old Hawk struggled
on with him in his decline, winning him a few pounds at country
races by his indomitable pluck, and carrying him miles and miles
when other people were at rest.&nbsp; Although Mr. Reynolds had
his failings, no one could impeach his honour.&nbsp; He possessed
such peculiar blandness, free from haughty and unkind feeling,
that he was always regarded with something more than the common
courtesy of life.&nbsp; He received, in his dying illness, the
greatest attention from his old servant Peter, his former
whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at
Sandringham, from Coventry, accompanied by Prince Albert Victor

old Corporation he served the office of Sheriff in 1832, and in
1838 was created a baronet.&nbsp; Sir William was elected Mayor
of Norwich in 1844.&nbsp; In politics he was a warm supporter of

of the old Whig school in Norwich.&nbsp; He was succeeded by
Capt. William Foster, formerly in the 11th Hussars.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at Golding Street, Heigham, Norwich, Mrs.

<p>&mdash;A remarkable charge of cruelty to dogs was preferred at
Norwich Police-court, against Dr. Eugene Magnan, of London, Mr.
Haynes S. Robinson, Mr. John Ballard Pitt, Mr. Richard Wentworth
White, and Mr. Horace Turner, well-known medical men residing in
Norwich.&nbsp; It was alleged that on the occasion of the visit
of the British Medical Association to Norwich, application was
made by a committee of gentlemen that a certain experiment,
namely, the injection of alcohol and absinthe into the veins and
bloodvessels of dogs, should be made.&nbsp; Dr. Magnan performed
the operation, and the other defendants took part.&nbsp; Among
the witnesses called for the prosecution was Dr. Tuffnell,
President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, who said
the experiment was cruel because unnecessary, and similar
evidence was given by Sir William Fergusson, Professor William
Pritchard, R.C.V.S., Professor Varnell, R.C.V.S., Mr. G. Fleming,
Examining Member of the Council of Veterinary Surgeons, and one
of the editors of the &ldquo;Veterinarian,&rdquo; and
others.&nbsp; For the defence it was denied that Dr. Magnan
performed the experiment simply for the amusement of those
present, and Dr. Beverley, Dr. Bateman, Dr. Eade, Dr. Copeman,
Mr. Cadge, Mr. W. P. Nichols, Mr. G. W. W. Firth, Mr. Joseph
Allen, and others were called to prove that the operation was
justifiable.&nbsp; The magistrates dismissed the charges, but
expressed the opinion that the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals were justified in bringing the case.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Died at 7, Lowndes Street, London, Mr. Peter Frank
O&rsquo;Malley, Q.C., last surviving son of Mr. Charles

at Christ Church, Oxford, and entered the Royal Horse Guards, in
which regiment he served in the Peninsular War, and was present
at the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; In 1823 he married Eleanor,
fifth daughter of Sir Edward Knatchbull, Bart., and in 1824, on
succeeding to the Elmham estate, assumed the name of Milles in
lieu of that of Watson.&nbsp; After his retirement from military
service, he took great interest in agricultural pursuits, and was
very successful in his efforts to improve the breeds of cattle

for its representation in Parliament.&nbsp; During his Mayoralty
in 1833 he wrote a letter to the Governor of the Court of
Guardians, suggesting the establishment of a joint stock company
for spinning yarn, in order to give employment to the poor.&nbsp;
The result was the formation of the Norwich Yarn Company, and the
first stone of their factory was laid by Mr. Bignold on December

indication of success, but it finally succumbed to the powerful
competition of the North.&nbsp; In 1848 Mr. Bignold was a second
time elected Mayor, and was chosen a third time for the office in

Samuel was again defeated, and Lord Bury was a second time
unseated on petition.&nbsp; In all subsequent elections, although
not a candidate himself, Sir Samuel Bignold continued to take an

by translating and writing several valuable articles for the

Owen Jones in the production of some volumes of combined art and
poetry which attracted much attention at the time of their
appearance.&nbsp; Miss Bacon was particularly happy in her
metrical translations of German, French, and Italian songs, and

ready talent in <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

tales in prose to the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Journal&rdquo; and

wincing, threatened to break down at the eighth lash; but the

was alleged on the part of the petitioner that a large number of
voters had received employment of a colourable character.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherever possible a voter was made a messenger, clerk, or
something.&nbsp; The majority for Mr. Huddleston at the General
Election was between 40 and 50, but by this kind of device the
Conservative majority was converted into a minority of one under
800.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inquiry proceeded, and on the 15th Mr.
Hawkins announced that &ldquo;Mr. Tillett had come to the
conclusion it had been sufficiently established that a great
number of the lower class voters were employed unjustifiably in
his behalf, and he felt he could not struggle further to retain
the seat.&rdquo;&nbsp; After hearing the evidence of Mr. Tillett
and a few other witnesses, his lordship said: &ldquo;The result
is the respondent has become disqualified by reason of this
corruption by his agents, and I have nothing more to do than to
declare the election void and award costs to the
petitioner.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> August 16th.)</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The centenary of the banking house of Messrs.
Gurneys and Co. was celebrated by a dinner given at Stoke Holy
Cross, the seat of Mr. Henry Birkbeck.&nbsp; &ldquo;The original
founders of the Bank were John and Henry Gurney, who, in addition
to their ordinary trade, that of merchants, carried on a banking
business, first in Pitt Street, and afterwards in Magdalen
Street.&nbsp; They were the sons of John Gurney, who earned the
title of the &lsquo;Weavers&rsquo; Friend,&rsquo; by reason of
his advocacy of their cause.&nbsp; The Gurneys having, in 1779,
devoted themselves exclusively to banking, the business was
transferred to Bartlett Gurney (son of Henry Gurney), who removed
to the present premises on Bank Plain, having as a partner his
uncle, John Gurney.&nbsp; Bartlett Gurney died in 1803, and John
Gurney was left sole proprietor, being joined shortly by his
cousins, Richard and Joseph Gurney.&nbsp; John Gurney lived at
Earlham Hall, Richard Gurney at Keswick, and Joseph Gurney at
Lakenham.&nbsp; Changes from time to time occurred, and Hudson
Gurney, Richard Hanbury Gurney, James John Gurney, Henry Birkbeck
(the father of the present head of the firm), and Simon Martin
became at subsequent periods partners in the great banking
house.&nbsp; The panics of the years 1792 and 1825, which caused
the failure of many banking houses, only resulted in establishing
the Gurneys on a firmer and more prosperous basis, for they not
only survived these financial disasters, but assisted others to
tide over their difficulties.&nbsp; The year 1866 will be
remembered as one which tested the stability of the house.&nbsp;
The run on the Bank in that and the following year was as
remarkable for its intensity as it was lasting.&nbsp; <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>The run
having ended, the business was further extended in 1870 by the
addition of that of Harveys and Hudsons, the goodwill of which
was purchased, and, by the liberality of the firm, that which
might have ended in a catastrophe for Norfolk was averted.&nbsp;
It is now by far the largest private banking house in the
provinces.&rdquo;</p>

Parliament, for placing restrictions on the fishing, and
resolutions to that effect were adopted.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

Mercury&rdquo; of May 11th, on the life and labours of Mr. Thomas
Baines, F.R.G.S., &ldquo;just then deceased,&rdquo; were
published.&nbsp; Mr. Baines was a native of King&rsquo;s Lynn,
where he was born in 1822.&nbsp; At an early age he gave evidence
of artistic instincts, and of his love of travel and
adventure.&nbsp; His first experiences of the kind were in South
Australia.&nbsp; When little more than a youth, he took part in
an expedition which traversed a then unpenetrated portion of the
Continent.&nbsp; He and his companions carried their lives in
their hands, and many were the hairbreadth escapes from the
perils of both sea and savages.&nbsp; Baines arrived in South
Africa about the year 1848, and took an active part in the Kaffir
wars of 1850&ndash;51&ndash;52.&nbsp; In 1860 he joined Dr.
Livingstone&rsquo;s expedition to Zanzibar, but differences arose
between him and his illustrious chief.&nbsp; The next few years
were spent in devious travel, and in 1866 he returned home and
published several important works.&nbsp; He subsequently went to
Natal as leader of a party sent out by the South African Gold
Fields Exploration Company, and it was at Natal that he spent a
large portion of the last few years of his life.</p>

<p>&mdash;A suit, the Archdeacon of Norwich <i>v.</i> William
Delph and William Thomas Gilbert, churchwardens of St. Augustine,
which came before the Consistory Court at Norwich, excited much
public comment.&nbsp; The case was heard originally in November,
1874, when the Chancellor decreed that the respondents, who had
desecrated the churchyard by throwing a portion of it into the
public road, should, by placing certain stones in the pathway and
wall, mark the ancient boundary of the churchyard.&nbsp; The
respondents not having obeyed the decree of the court,
application was made on October 5th by Mr. Walter Overbury, as
Proctor for the Archdeacon, that they might be pronounced
contumacious.&nbsp; The case was adjourned until this date, and
the decree not having been obeyed, the Chancellor pronounced the
respondents contumacious, and issued a certificate to her Majesty
in the High Court of Justice, in order that an attachment might
forthwith issue against them.&nbsp; This action resulted in the
arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Gilbert.&nbsp; At a meeting of the
Town Council, on December 21st, Mr. J. D. Smith called attention
to the case, and stated that Mr. Gilbert was imprisoned for
alleged contempt of court in not paying the costs of the
suit.&nbsp; He moved a resolution expressing regret that the
ecclesiastical authorities should have instituted the
prosecution, and urging that the Parliamentary and Bye-Laws
Committee confer immediately as to the best steps to be taken to
obtain the release of the prisoner.&nbsp; The motion was carried
by 27 votes against 1, &ldquo;the Conservatives having vacated
their seats, leaving only Mr. H. W. Stafford, who voted against
the motion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gilbert was liberated on December

261</span>7.&mdash;At the annual dinner of the Farmers&rsquo;
Club, held at the Salisbury Hotel, London, Mr. Clare Sewell Read
announced that he would no longer continue a member of the
Government.&nbsp; He took office, he said, on the stipulation
that he should have perfect freedom to speak upon all
agricultural matters, and that if he believed the interests of
agriculture were neglected by any department of the Government he
should resign.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that the interests of the stockholders of this country
have been persistently ignored by the Veterinary Department of
the Privy Council, and that being the case, I have to inform you
that I am no longer the Secretary of the Local Government Board,
and that I only hold office until my successor be
appointed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Read further said that, to a
tenant-farmer whose principal income was derived from the
occupation of 600 or 700 acres of land, &pound;1,500 a year was
an extremely convenient addition to his income; but he was quite
sure that all present would approve of what he had done.&nbsp;
During the Cattle Show week it was announced that some suitable
recognition would be made of Mr. Read&rsquo;s services to
agriculture, and, at a large meeting of the agriculturists of the
county&mdash;Conservative and Liberal&mdash;held at the Norfolk
Hotel, Norwich, on December 18th, a deputation was appointed to
attend a meeting at the Salisbury Hotel, on the 20th, in support
of the testimonial fund which was forthwith inaugurated.&nbsp;
(<i>See</i> January 1st, 1876.)</p>
<p>13.&mdash;A dreadful tragedy occurred at the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; A weaver, 42 years of age, named Robert
Edwards, who resided at Marsham, had been admitted to the
Hospital on an indoor recommendation obtained from the Rev. J.
Gunton, rector of the parish.&nbsp; The physician who examined
him prior to admission believed that he was suffering from some
bodily ailment of a dyspeptic character.&nbsp; Ten or twelve
weeks previously his case was regarded as one of insanity; he had
been restless and violent at times, and his friends had placed
him under surveillance.&nbsp; Early on the morning of this date,
Edwards, in a fit of homicidal mania, escaped from the Catherine
ward, and, finding his way to the children&rsquo;s ward, seized a
pair of tongs from the fireplace, and, before he could be
secured, made a murderous assault upon some of the unfortunate
young patients, which resulted in two being slain outright, a
third died shortly afterwards, and grievous injuries were
inflicted upon two others.&nbsp; Edwards was disarmed by Mr.
Baumgartner, the house surgeon, taken into custody, and charged
on the 14th, at Norwich Police Court, with feloniously killing
William Martin, aged 14, of Ryburgh; John Lacey, 10, of Griffin
Yard, Pockthorpe; and Joseph Colman, 11, of Barton Turf.&nbsp; A
fourth lad, Alfred Clarke, aged 9, died on February 20th,
1876.&nbsp; On the 18th the magistrates committed him for trial
at the Assizes, but meanwhile he was certified to be insane and
incapable of pleading, and was sent to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic
Asylum.&nbsp; At the Coroner&rsquo;s inquest, held on December
18th, a verdict of wilful murder was returned, and the jury
expressed, in the strongest terms, their disapproval of the
circumstances under which Edwards had been admitted to the
institution, and their high opinion of the courageous conduct of
Mr. Baumgartner.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died at Bombay, Bernard Edward Delaval Astley, tenth
Baron Hastings, aged 20.&nbsp; His lordship left England early in

time vicar of East Barsham, and afterwards ninth Lord Hastings,
and grandson of Jacob Astley, Lord Hastings, better known by his
former name of Sir Jacob Astley, M.P.&nbsp; He was educated at
Eton, and succeeded to the family honours in 1872.&nbsp; The
title passed to his next brother, the Hon. George Manners Astley,
who was born in April, 1857.</p>

Cannon Street Hotel, London, on May 2nd, at a banquet presided
over by Mr. Charles Howard, of Bidenham, and attended by 160 of
the leading agriculturists of the three kingdoms.&nbsp; The
testimonial consisted of a massive silver salver weighing 115

<p>19.&mdash;The first of the entertainments known as
&ldquo;Spelling Bees&rdquo; was given at Noverre&rsquo;s Rooms,

C. Copeman, and Mr. A. Master, and their decisions were in
accordance with the Imperial, Richardson&rsquo;s, and
Walker&rsquo;s dictionaries.&nbsp; Mr. T. Richmond Pinder was
interrogator.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spelling Bees&rdquo; enjoyed for some
months the same popularity as their precursors, &ldquo;Penny
Readings,&rdquo; and every town and village in the county took up
the movement, which, however, was very short-lived.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The members of the Yare Preservation Society and the
riparian owners of the county adopted a memorial to the Home
Secretary, praying for the legislative protection of local sea

Victoria, he was one of the deputation who presented, on behalf
of the city, an address of congratulation to her Majesty and the
Prince Consort.&nbsp; Mr. Barwell engaged largely in artistic
pursuits, and was an accomplished musician and vocalist.&nbsp; A
skilful amateur artist, he painted a portrait of Miss Julia
Smith, daughter of Mr. William Smith, M.P., and aunt of Florence
Nightingale, which was exhibited at the National Portrait
Gallery, South Kensington, in 1868.&nbsp; He did much to promote
art in Norwich, and, in conjunction with Cotman, Crome, and other
Norwich artists, established a drawing academy.&nbsp; Many years

281</span>3.&mdash;Died at Camperdown Place, Great Yarmouth, Mr.
William Thurtell, in his 83rd year.&nbsp; Mr. Thurtell, who was a

<p>6.&mdash;In the House of Lords, before the Lord Chancellor,
Lord Penzance, Lord Blackburn, and Lord Gordon, the action, Read
<i>v.</i> Bailey, was heard, on an appeal from a decision by the
Lords Justices.&nbsp; On an inspection of the books of the Bank
on the failure of the firm of Harveys and Hudsons, in 1870, it
was discovered that Sir Robert Harvey had abstracted large sums
of money from the coffers of the Bank, and had sought to cover
the deficiency by the opening of fictitious accounts, and by
crediting forged bills to his private account.&nbsp; In
consequence, the trustee under the bankruptcy of the firm
preferred a claim against the separate estate of Sir Robert
Harvey, amounting to the sum of &pound;600,000, for the moneys so
abstracted by Sir Robert Harvey in his lifetime.&nbsp; This claim
was, in 1876, supported by a great mass of evidence before the
Master of the Rolls, who decided in favour of the claim, and gave
the trustee of Harveys and Hudsons the right to rank as a
creditor against the private or separate estate of Sir Robert
Harvey, in competition with the stockbrokers and other private
creditors.&nbsp; The importance of the decision of the Master of
the Rolls, as affecting the interests of the stockbrokers, was
great.&nbsp; But for this claim of &pound;600,000 they would have
received 20s. in the pound on their debts, whereas the allowance
of the claim to rank in competition with their debts prevented
Sir Robert Harvey&rsquo;s private estate paying more than 6s. 8d.
in the pound.&nbsp; The stockbrokers accordingly appealed to the
Lords Justices against the decision of the Master of the Rolls,
and their lordships upheld the claim of &pound;600,000, and
dismissed the stockbrokers&rsquo; appeal, with costs.&nbsp; The
stockbrokers now appealed to the House of Lords, who confirmed
the judgments of the Lords Justices and the Master of the Rolls,
and dismissed the appeal, with costs; in other words, admitting
the trustee&rsquo;s claim for &pound;600,000.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

282</span>26.&mdash;The new Middle Level Sluice, at Wiggenhall
St. Mary, near King&rsquo;s Lynn, was opened by Mr. E. Fellowes,
M.P., chairman of the Middle Level Commission.&nbsp; This sluice
replaced the one designed by Mr. J. Walker and constructed by
Brogden, of Manchester, at the cost of &pound;30,000, in 1842,
which gave way on May 4th, 1862, with the widespread and
disastrous consequences known as the Middle Level
inundation.&nbsp; After many unsuccessful attempts to construct a
dam across the drain, Sir John Hawkshaw, C.E., was called in, and
he eventually succeeded in that object, and under his advice
sixteen large iron syphons, with the necessary engine and
apparatus for exhausting air from them, were constructed upon the
dam, so as to secure an outlet of the drainage without admitting
sea water from the Ouze.&nbsp; These syphons answered very well
for years, but were not equal to the task.&nbsp; The
Commissioners went to Parliament in 1874, and obtained powers to
raise money to construct a new sluice, from designs by Sir J.
Hawkshaw, at an estimated cost of between &pound;50,000 and
&pound;60,000, and the work was commenced by the contractor, Mr.
Webster, in September, 1874.</p>

<p>&mdash;The memorable and disastrous flood occurred at
Norwich.&nbsp; A heavy fall of snow on the 12th, followed by a
rapid thaw and continuous rain, had the effect of greatly
swelling the tributaries of the Yare and Wensum.&nbsp;
Simultaneously, a north-west wind occasioned a high tide at
Yarmouth, so that the river waters were denied their natural
outlet.&nbsp; Instead of ebbing with the tide, the Yare rose
steadily on the 15th, and many thousand acres of marshes lying
between Norwich and Yarmouth were inundated on the following
day.&nbsp; The New Mills at Norwich, were, however, responsible
for the greater part of the damage from which the city
suffered.&nbsp; The obstruction caused the waters to overflow the
banks of the river, and, in a short time, many of the streets in
the low-lying localities were flooded, and hundreds of the
inhabitants were compelled to leave their houses by means of
boats.&nbsp; An enormous amount of distress prevailed.&nbsp; The
Mayor (Mr. Harry Bullard) convened a meeting at the Guildhall on
the 17th (Sunday), at which it was decided to establish centres
for the distribution of provisions; and permission was obtained
from the Government authorities to make use of the
governor&rsquo;s house at the disused City Gaol for the
accommodation of the houseless people, of whom 200 found refuge
there.&nbsp; The Sessions Court at the Guildhall was opened
during the day as a store-house, in which 2,600 loaves of bread
and many hundreds of blankets, received from the County Gaol,
Asylum, Workhouse, and Cavalry Barracks, were placed ready for
distribution.&nbsp; At 6.30 on the same evening another

people.&nbsp; On the 18th a third meeting took place, at which a
relief fund was inaugurated, when, in a few minutes, &pound;2,271
13s. 6d. was subscribed, an amount which, by the end of the week,
was increased to &pound;4,200.&nbsp; Three or four persons lost
their lives in the flood.&nbsp; In various parts of the county
rivers overflowed their banks, and much damage was done to
property.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 4th, 1879.)</p>
<p>18.&mdash;An art loan exhibition, largely contributed to by
noblemen and others in the Eastern Counties, was opened at St.

Mancroft.&nbsp; An inaugural ode, specially written by Mr. E
Oxenford, and composed by Dr. Bunnett, <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>was
performed by members of the Norfolk and Norwich Musical
Union.&nbsp; The exhibition remained open until December 14th,

<p>19.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, the

Road, Chapel Field Road, Queen&rsquo;s Road, Upper Surrey Street,
All Saints&rsquo; Green, Golden Ball Street, Castle Meadow,
Prince of Wales Road, Foundry Bridge, and Thorpe Road to
Whitlingham Railway Station.&nbsp; An adjourned meeting was held
on December 17th, at which it was agreed not to oppose the Bill,
provided the Tramways Company consented to the insertion of such
clauses, conditions, and restrictions as, in the opinion of the
Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee might be deemed
necessary.&nbsp; The Norwich Tramways Bill was considered by a
Select Committee of the House of Commons, on May 6th, 1879.&nbsp;
It was opposed by the Great Eastern Railway Company and Mr.
Foster, a local resident, and thrown out after only the
promoters&rsquo; case had been heard.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January
16th, 1883.)</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The Norfolk and Norwich Fat Cattle Show was opened

death of Mr. J. G. Crosse, Mr. Nichols was elected surgeon of the
Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, a position he held for twenty-two
years, and relinquished the post in 1872, when probably the
highest possible testimony was paid to his skill as an operator
by Dr. Copeman, who mentioned that in lithotomy his average of
successful cases was higher <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>than that of Dr. Donne, Dr.
Martineau, or Mr. Norgate, all giants in their day.&nbsp; On his
retirement from office he was unanimously appointed honorary
consulting surgeon.&nbsp; Mr. Nichols was also consulting surgeon
to the Bethel Hospital, and, with Mr. J. F. Watson, successfully
carried on for many years the private asylum at Heigham
Hall.&nbsp; He was elected Mayor of Norwich in 1865, and had the
honour to take the lead in the reception of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Queen of

the battle of Inkerman he was taken prisoner, and on his release
acted as <i>aide-de-camp</i> to General Syssons, who commanded
the Second Brigade Light Division until the end of the war.&nbsp;
Captain Duff then embarked with his regiment for China, but the
Indian Mutiny breaking out meanwhile, they were ordered to
Calcutta, to assist in its suppression.&nbsp; Captain Duff was
present with Lord Clyde at the capture of Lucknow, and was
specially mentioned in dispatches for his services.&nbsp; He
received the Crimean medal with two clasps, the Turkish medal,
the 5th class of the Medjidie, &amp;c.&nbsp; In 1858 he left the
service, and the following year married Mary, only daughter of
Mr. Edward Dawkins, of Upper Brooke Street, London, and niece of
Mr. John Berney Petre, of Westwick House.&nbsp; On taking up his
residence in the county, he was appointed to the command of the
3rd Administrative Battalion of Norfolk Rifle Volunteers, and, on
the death of the Hon. Frederick Walpole, was returned as
Conservative member for North Norfolk.&nbsp; In conjunction with
Sir Robert Buxton, Mr. Clare Sewell Read, Mr. Colman, and Sir

the recent floods, and for devising some means to prevent their
recurrence.&rdquo;&nbsp; A committee was appointed to hold an
inquiry, and in the month of June Sir John Hawkshaw, C.E., made a
report, in which he stated that floods might be prevented by
suitable works, the cost of which would be heavy if charged
entirely on the flooded lands, but moderate if spread in suitable
proportions.&nbsp; Mr. Bullard, on November 10th, was presented
with his portrait, painted by Mr. Ventnor, in recognition of the
services he had rendered to his fellow-citizens during the

removing shingle, mussels, and cockles.&nbsp; Mr. le Strange in
1866 took legal proceedings to maintain his proprietary rights on
the foreshore, and obtained a verdict, against which an appeal
was entered; but a full bench of judges confirmed the

supported by the majority and opposed by the Denominational
minority, the latter of whom asserted that the proposal could be
carried out only by rescinding a resolution passed almost
unanimously at a previous meeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Finding their
last effort useless to stem the current of expenditure into which
the Board had plunged, and justly indignant at the treatment they
received, the minority left the room, and Canon Heaviside

they ever again entered it.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May 8th a deputation
went to Canon Heaviside&rsquo;s residence and presented to the
gentlemen constituting the minority a memorial, signed by the
ratepayers, urging that by their presence at the Board they could
&ldquo;continue to protest against reckless extravagance, and so
keep the ratepayers better informed of what is going
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ultimately the minority agreed to resume their
duties, &ldquo;at the request of their constituents, and in the
hope that the public attention called to the proceedings which
led to their withdrawal would have the effect of strengthening
their hands in the endeavour to discharge effectively the duties
that devolved upon them.&rdquo;</p>

been made on the following grounds: (1) That in consequence of
the increase of railways, there was comparatively but little
through traffic along the disturnpiked reads; <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>(2) there
being no highway districts in the county, the Court was not
prepared to encounter the difficulty and expense of dealing
separately with the surveyors of the large number of parishes
through which the disturnpiked roads passed; (3) that should a
highway board be established in the county, the unions through
which the disturnpiked roads passed would not be unfairly
burdened by their maintenance, while it would be hard upon
outlying districts of the county to contribute to the repair of
roads which they never used; and (4) that the Court having
previously expressed itself in favour of county boards, hesitated
to sanction so novel and large an expenditure for the county rate
as would be involved in paying half the cost of repairing the
disturnpiked roads until the ratepayers were more directly
represented in the county authority.&nbsp; Mr. C. S. Read, M.P.,
stated his reasons for moving these resolutions at the Court of
Quarter Sessions, and after evidence had been taken in regard to
each road in question, the Inspector said that he should make his
report.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>19.&mdash;A glove fight took place at the Corn Hall, Norwich,
in the presence of an immense audience, between Walter Emms and
Arthur Shaw.&nbsp; At the Police Court, on the 26th, the
principals, and John Hicks, James Clarke, James Laxton, Robert
Watson, sub-editor of the &ldquo;Sporting Life,&rdquo; London;
Thomas Snelling, and Edwin Cunningham were summoned for
unlawfully assembling together for the purpose of a
prize-fight.&nbsp; Emms and Shaw were ordered to enter into their
own recognisances of &pound;100, to find two sureties of
&pound;50 each, and to keep the peace for six months.&nbsp; The
other defendants were bound over in the sum of &pound;20 each to
keep the peace for six months.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The Norwich Omnibus Company, Limited, was
formed.&nbsp; The first omnibuses were put upon the Dereham Road
route on June 23rd.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at the Crescent, Norwich, Mr. John M. Croker, aged
57.&nbsp; His ample leisure enabled him to be of great service to
many of the public institutions of the city, and he was for
several years honorary secretary of the Norfolk and Norwich
Cricket Club.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;A fire occurred on Messrs. Willis and
Southall&rsquo;s shoe premises, the Upper Market, Norwich.&nbsp;
The damage was estimated at &pound;1,000.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A case of considerable importance to the agricultural
community, in which the Earl of Leicester, Lord Lieutenant of the
county, was defendant, was heard by the Walsingham
magistrates.&nbsp; His lordship was alleged to have infringed the
Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, and the Animals Order of
1878.&nbsp; The informations, laid by the Veterinary Inspector of
the district (Mr. Edward Case), charged his lordship (1) with
unlawfully causing to be driven on March 3rd a sheep affected
with sheep scab; and (2) with causing 200 suspected animals to be
removed.&nbsp; After a hearing which lasted eight hours, the
Bench dismissed the case, &ldquo;because the defendant had
satisfied them that there was no cause for suspecting the animals
removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>5.&mdash;A singular accident occurred at Wells railway
station.&nbsp; The driver of engine of a passenger train from
Norwich was unable to control the brakes, and the engine dashing
into the station, knocked down the buffer stops, ran through the
end platform, and, crashing into the lavatories and
porter&rsquo;s room, demolished the outer wall of the station,
and came to a standstill when partly in the public street.&nbsp;
A young man named John Cook was killed.&nbsp; At the inquest a
verdict of accidental death was returned, and at the subsequent
Board of Trade inquiry the engine-driver was exonerated of
blame.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;St. Giles&rsquo; Hall, Norwich, originally opened as
a skating rink, and afterwards used as a variety hall and
theatre, was on this date opened for the summer season as a
circus by Mr. Stoodley.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The Summer Show of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association was opened at East Dereham, when the entries were
larger than on any previous occasion.&nbsp; Mr. R. T. Gurdon was
president.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;The Norwich Artillery Volunteers paraded for the
first time in their new uniform.&nbsp; The regulation scarlet
facings and helmet of the Royal Artillery had been substituted
for the white facings and busby previously worn.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The Prince of Wales visited Norwich, for the purpose
of laying the foundation-stone of the new Norfolk and Norwich
Hospital.&nbsp; The visit was of a semi-private character.&nbsp;
His Royal Highness, who was received at Thorpe Station by the
Mayor (Mr. Harry Bullard), the Sheriff (Mr. Donald Steward), the
Earl of Leicester, Lord Suffield, and Lord Carrington, proceeded
to the site of the new building, and having performed the
ceremony, returned to the station and travelled by special train
to Yarmouth.&nbsp; The cost of the new Hospital was originally
estimated at &pound;35,500, but the Board of Governors
subsequently decided to purchase adjoining property, at an
additional outlay of &pound;5,000.&nbsp; The Board afterwards
adopted a building design jointly prepared by Mr. T. H. Wyatt, of
London, and Mr. Edward Boardman, of Norwich, and accepted the
tender of Messrs. Lacey and Co. for the completion of the
work.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> June 30th, 1881.)</p>
<p>&mdash;The Prince of Wales arrived at Yarmouth, and on the
18th inspected the Prince of Wales&rsquo; Own Norfolk
Artillery.&nbsp; His Royal Highness left on the morning of the
19th.&nbsp; On both evenings of his stay in the town, the Prince
attended performances given by the Gaiety Company at the Theatre
Royal.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council,
Mr. J. H. Tillett moved, &ldquo;That this Council objects to the
proposed schemes of the Charity Commissioners, particularly to
those relating to the Boys&rsquo; Hospital and the Girls&rsquo;
Hospital Schools, on the ground that educational and other funds
given expressly and emphatically for the benefit of the poor are
thereby diverted from their proper objects, and applied to the
increase of the endowments in middle and upper schools, which
schools, if in need, should be helped otherwise than at the
expense of the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was adopted, and the
Parliamentary and Bylaw Committee were requested to prepare a
petition against the scheme.&nbsp; A Common Hall was held on July
16th, at which resolutions were adopted expressing
dissatisfaction with the scheme; and at a meeting of the Town
Council, on August 26th, the Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee,
in a draft report upon the scheme, urged that to apply grants
originally given for the maintenance, education, and <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>advancement
of the children of the poor, in aid of the Grammar and Commercial
Schools, or either of them, would involve a misappropriation of
the funds and a violation of the intentions of the
founders.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> October 24th, 1882.)</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;At the Norfolk county magistrates&rsquo; meeting, a
report was received from the Committee of Visitors that several
serious cases of erysipelas, sore throat, and diarrhoea had
occurred at Thorpe Asylum, &ldquo;and it would appear that the
very offensive smell which pervades the Asylum whenever the wind
blows from the Sewage Farm on the opposite side of the river is
the cause of the above-named epidemics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;In the House of Commons, Mr. C. S. Read supported, in
a long and able speech, Mr. Chaplin&rsquo;s motion, for a Royal
Commission to enquire into the depressed condition of the
agricultural interest.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at the Vyne, Basingstoke, Mr. W. L. Wiggett
Chute, aged 79, formerly of Pickenham Hall, near Swaffham.&nbsp;
He was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1827, in which
year he assumed, by Royal licence, the additional name and arms
of Chute, on inheriting the estates of that ancient family in
Hampshire and Norfolk.&nbsp; He was elected with Sir William
Bagge in the Conservative interest at the General Election of
1837, and held the seat until 1847, when he retired.&nbsp; In
1837 he married Martha, second daughter of Mr. Theophilus Russell
Buckworth, of Cockley Cley.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;A &ldquo;silver cradle,&rdquo; in the form of a
massive epergne, was presented by the Corporation to the Mayor of
Norwich (Mr. Harry Bullard), &ldquo;in commemoration of the birth
of his daughter, Hilda May, on May 13th, 1879.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Died at Kett&rsquo;s Castle Villa, Mousehold,
Norwich, Mr. John Berney Ladbrooke.&nbsp; Born in 1803, he was a
son of Robert Ladbrooke, painter and drawing master, and nephew
of Old Crome, whose pupil he became after he had received
rudimentary instruction from his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Crome&rsquo;s influence is traced in nearly all his
pictures, although of late years in tone and colour they more
closely resemble the best works of Henry Bright.&nbsp; He
especially excelled in the representation of woodland
scenery.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a drawing master Ladbrooke was much
valued.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at Norwich, Mr. John Withers Dowson.&nbsp; A
son of Mr. Benjamin Dowson, merchant, of Geldeston, he was born
in 1800.&nbsp; Educated at Norwich Grammar School, he was
articled to a London firm of solicitors, and afterwards commenced
practice in Norwich.&nbsp; The pursuit of professional emolument
was, however, less an object with him than the furtherance of the
education and the improvement of those around him, especially the
poor, and probably no one in the city or county had in his time
done more practical work in the cause of education.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;An inter-county bicycle race, between Norfolk and
Suffolk cyclists, was ridden from Ipswich to Norwich.&nbsp; The
competitors started from Ipswich at 3.5 p.m., and the race was
won by Popplewell, of Ipswich, who arrived at the Boileau
fountain, Norwich, at 6.5 p.m.&nbsp; Morgan, of Yarmouth, was
second.&nbsp; The distance ridden was forty-three miles.</p>
<p><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>15.&mdash;An important question affecting the boundary
of the city came before the Norwich Town Council.&nbsp; The Town
Clerk reported that, in the preparation of the Ordnance Survey, a
question had arisen as to whether two pieces of land, one
containing about 38 acres, situate in the parish of Catton, and
the other of about 45 acres, with 150 houses thereon, situate in
the parish of Sprowston, should not be included within the
Parliamentary and municipal boundary of the city and county of
the city of Norwich.&nbsp; On investigating the matter, it
appeared that, by the charter of Philip and Mary, granted to the
city in 1556, these two inclosures of land were clearly defined
as being within the city boundary, and by several ancient
manuscripts and books, including Blomefield&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Norfolk,&rdquo; reference was also made to
these lands as belonging to the city.&nbsp; It also appeared by
the report of the Commissioners appointed to report on the
boundaries of boroughs and corporate towns, by order of the House
of Commons, on April 25th, 1837, that such lands were within the
city jurisdiction, and a plan attached to such report
corroborated the fact.&nbsp; The matter being important, and the
Town Clerk having been requested to state whether the city
authorities were willing in the new survey to allow such lands to
be shown as forming part of the county of Norfolk, it was
referred to the Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee, for further
investigation and consideration.&nbsp; On August 26th, the
Committee reported that they had consulted the Town Clerk and
Major Jones, of the Ordnance Survey, had referred to extracts
from charters and from Blomefield, and had resolved that
sufficient evidence had not been produced to set forth where the
boundary of the city of Norwich should be drawn, and that,
therefore, they left Major Jones to define it as he might think
best, without prejudice to the rights of any party.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The 3rd and 4th Battalions of Norfolk Rifle
Volunteers went into camp on Yarmouth South Denes.&nbsp; Colonel
Bulwer, who had succeeded Colonel Duff, was in command of the 3rd
Battalion, and Lieut.-Colonel Gurdon commanded the 4th
Battalion.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Owing to a heavy and continuous downpour of rain and
a strong wind blowing from the north-west, the waters of the Yare
were &ldquo;backed up,&rdquo; overflowed the banks of the river,
and submerged many thousand acres of marshes between Norwich and
Yarmouth.&nbsp; Most of the hay crop in Norfolk was ruined by the
wet weather.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A silver epergne was presented to Mr. E. H. H.
Combe, Mayor of Yarmouth, as a &ldquo;silver cradle,&rdquo; to
commemorate the birth of a daughter in his year of office.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Particulars were published on this date of the
establishment of the Norwich Steam Laundry and Public Baths, at
North Heigham.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A remarkable landslip occurred at
Attleborough.&nbsp; As Mr. Gathergood, a farmer, whose land lay
partly in Attleborough and Rockland, was crossing a turnip field,
he was stunned by a loud report resembling the roar of a cannon,
immediately followed by a rustling noise within a yard or two of
him.&nbsp; On recovering his presence of mind, he discovered that
a space of land twenty-four yards in circumference had sunk out
of sight, and water was rising in its stead.&nbsp; On the 28th
the water subsided, and revealed a chasm from thirty-five to
forty feet deep, with perfectly perpendicular sides.&nbsp; This
strange phenomenon was attributed to the action of the heavy
rainfall.</p>
<h4><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A terrible thunderstorm and hurricane commenced in
the night and prevailed during the early hours of the morning of
the 3rd (Sunday).&nbsp; It was accompanied by a deluge of rain
and a heavy hailstorm.&nbsp; Great damage was done to property in
city and county.&nbsp; But the greatest calamity was the
destruction of Wells church, the tower of which was struck by
lightning at 5.50 a.m. on the 3rd.&nbsp; The roof of the nave was
soon in flames, and fell in with a crash, and by nine
o&rsquo;clock the whole church was reduced to a state of utter
ruin.&nbsp; The fine peal of bells was totally destroyed, and the
entire damage was estimated at from &pound;10,000 to
&pound;15,000.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 18th, 1883.)</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Died at Oxford Street, Unthank&rsquo;s Road, Norwich,
Mr. Thomas William Bond, in his 76th year.&nbsp; Mr. Bond was
some time subeditor, and afterwards publisher, of the
&ldquo;Norfolk News,&rdquo; and before removing to Norwich kept a
school at Barton Mills, near Stoke Ferry.&nbsp; He was the
compiler of a small book for children, known as
&ldquo;Bond&rsquo;s Catechism,&rdquo; which was published by
Jarrold, and for many years extensively used in all parts of the
country.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;Died at the residence of his son, Belmont House,
Newport, Essex, Zachariah Buck, Mus. Doc.&nbsp; He was born at
Norwich on September 19th, 1798, and at an early age attracted
the attention of Dr. Beckwith, the then organist of the
Cathedral, who took him into the choir.&nbsp; Dr. Beckwith died
in 1809, and was succeeded as organist by his son, Mr. John
Beckwith, with whom young Buck continued, and to whom he was
articled.&nbsp; On the death of Beckwith, in 1819, Buck, at the
early age of twenty-one, succeeded in obtaining the appointment
of Cathedral organist, his chief competitor being Alfred Pettet,
a fellow-pupil, who was appointed to St. Peter Mancroft.&nbsp;
Buck soon obtained a large and lucrative practice as a teacher,
and established his reputation as a trainer of boys.&nbsp; For
nearly forty years he continued to perform the active duties of
organist and choirmaster, but during the last twenty years of his
life he relinquished the organ to his subsequent assistant and
partner, Dr. Bunnett.&nbsp; Besides instructing during his long
career some 7,000 amateur pupils, Dr. Buck trained a very large
number of professional students, most of whom were selected from
his choir.&nbsp; He composed no great work, but was the author of
a number of pleasing anthems, and of the hymn, &ldquo;Come
hither, angel tongues invite,&rdquo; which, it was understood,
gained for him his Lambeth degree of Doctor of Music, conferred
upon him by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; He resigned, on
June 5th, 1877, his appointment at the Cathedral, after seventy
years&rsquo; connection therewith.&nbsp; Dr. Buck was twice
married&mdash;first to Miss Hansell, and secondly to Miss
Holloway, and left three sons.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The British, Arch&aelig;ological Association opened
its congress at Yarmouth.&nbsp; Lord Waveney, as president,
delivered an inaugural address.&nbsp; The members of the Congress
visited Norwich on the 18th.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Mr. C. S. Read, M.P., having declined the invitation
of the Government to become a member of the Royal Commission
appointed to enquire into the depressed state of agriculture and
its causes, and believing that he could serve farmers better
another way, sailed on this date from Liverpool for America, in
the City of Montreal liner, in company with Mr. Albert Pell,
M.P.&nbsp; The object of the hon. gentlemen <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>was to
collect, in the United States, information conducive to the
inquiry, and this duty they undertook as unpaid assistant
commissioners.&nbsp; They made a tour through the Western
agricultural regions of Manitoba, Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
Kentucky, went south-west to Texas, and returned to Philadelphia
on November 26th.&nbsp; They thoroughly examined the system of
cultivation, transportation, and ocean shipment of provisions and
grain; they travelled an average of 120 miles each day, besides
making minute investigations; and in this work they were greatly
assisted by the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway, who gave them
the use of a special train for a week.&nbsp; They examined the
terminal and shipping facilities of the Pennsylvania railroad,
the American steamship line at Philadelphia, and the Abbatoir
Company&rsquo;s arrangements for the shipping of live and dead
meat.&nbsp; After visiting Baltimore, Washington, and New York,
Mr. Read and Mr. Pell sailed for home on December 10th.&nbsp; Mr.
Read arrived in Norfolk on December 22nd, and was welcomed at
Wymondham station by Mrs. Read and several personal friends.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Town Clerk reported, at a meeting of the Norwich
Town Council, that the Norwich Improvement Act received the Royal
assent on July 22nd.&nbsp; Among the works which it enabled the
city to undertake was to remove Foundry Bridge and construct a
new one forty-five feet wide; to build a bridge across the Wensum
at St. Martin-at-Oak, and to exercise increased powers in the
sanitary administration and local government of the city.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The death was announced, at Brussels, of Lord Gordon
of Drumearn, who, when Lord Advocate for Scotland, in 1867, was
returned as member of Parliament for the borough of Thetford.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>16.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council adopted a resolution
authorising the paving of the Provision Market with wood, at a
cost not exceeding &pound;1,100.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> August 31st,
1880.)</p>
<p>&mdash;The improvement of Chapel Field, Norwich, was, after
many delays, ordered by the Town Council to be undertaken, at a
sum not exceeding &pound;1,000, the cost to be charged to the
sanitary rate.&nbsp; On November 7th the Mayor and Mayoress (Mr.
and Mrs. Bullard) and Mrs. Donald Steward planted the first of
the new trees.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> November 4th, 1880.)</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Died at Norwich, in his 70th year, the Rev. William
Grigson, M.A., for thirty-three years rector of Whinburgh and
Westfield.&nbsp; A son of Mr. Edward Harvey Grigson, of Saham
Toney, he was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and
married, in 1844, Margaret, third daughter of Mr. James Hales, of
Norwich.&nbsp; The first of his ancestors to settle in the county
was the Rev. William Grigson, M.A., rector of Hardingham, in
1584, and since that period they have continued to reside in
Norfolk, where they once held a large extent of landed
property.&nbsp; Mr. Grigson&rsquo;s favourite studies were
arch&aelig;ology <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>and genealogy.&nbsp; As an authority upon the latter,
his assistance was sought from all parts of the kingdom, and his
name will always be remembered in connection with the
&ldquo;Visitations of Norfolk,&rdquo; of which work he was a
joint editor.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died at the Chantry, Norwich, in his 77th year, Mr.
G. Pinson, formerly Governor of Norwich Castle.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Died at Knapton House, Sir Henry Robinson, K.B., in
his 76th year.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. George Robinson, and
served for some years in her Majesty&rsquo;s Bodyguard of
Gentlemen-at-Arms, of which he was appointed Standard-Bearer in
1840, and Lieutenant-Commanding in 1845.&nbsp; In 1842 he married
Lucy, daughter of Mr. W. D. Cooper-Cooper, of Toddington Manor,
Bedford.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;The Norwich Diocesan Conference was opened at
Noverre&rsquo;s Rooms, Norwich, under the presidency of the Lord
Bishop.&nbsp; The proceedings were continued on the 7th.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council, owing to political
differences, were unable to elect a Mayor.&nbsp; Mr. Willis was
nominated and declared elected, but refused to take office.&nbsp;
Mr. Philip Back having been appointed Sheriff, the meeting was
adjourned until the 22nd, when the Liberal party declining to
nominate, Colonel Bignold proposed Mr. Samuel Newman, who refused
to accept the position.&nbsp; Another adjournment was made to the
28th, when Mr. Harry Bullard declared his readiness, by accepting
the office for another year, to relieve the city of the stigma
cast upon it.&nbsp; The meeting then adjourned until December
2nd, when Mr. Bullard was re-elected.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Mr. Frank Buckland and Mr. Spencer Walpole,
Inspectors of Fisheries, opened an inquiry at Cromer as to an
application for an Order prohibiting either entirely or subject
to such exceptions and restrictions as the Board of Trade might
determine, the fishing for and taking of small edible crabs and
berried hen lobsters.&nbsp; A similar inquiry was held at
Sheringham on the 19th.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The Norwich Fat Cattle Show was opened at Chapel
Field, and was continued on the 21st and 22nd.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;Died at Westbourne Terrace, Hyde Park, London, Mr.
John Unthank.&nbsp; The third son of Mr. William Unthank, of
Norwich, a solicitor in considerable practice and agent to Mr.
Coke, afterwards Earl of Leicester, he was born in 1798.&nbsp; In
1842 he was called to the Bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and joined
the Northern Circuit, where, for several years, he practised as a
special pleader.&nbsp; In 1859 he was appointed a Master of the
Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, and held the post until 1878, when
he retired, in consequence of ill-health.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Died at 18, Bethel Street, Norwich, Mr. Frederick
Lawrence Phillips, journalist, for many years editor and part
proprietor of the &ldquo;Norwich Argus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Phillips, who was sixty years of age, was <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>originally
intended for the legal profession, but took to the stage, upon
which he achieved fair success, and married Miss Ellen Daly, a
prominent actress of her day.&nbsp; An unfortunate accident,
while playing Rob Roy, at Norwich Theatre, terminated his hope of
advancement in the theatrical profession.&nbsp; Confined to his
couch for some time, he employed himself in the study of
languages, and subsequently devoted himself to the translation of
tales and dramas, and to the production of original dramatic
works.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The Rev. Osborne W. Tancock, M.A., of Exeter College,
Oxford, seventeen years master at Sherborne School, was appointed
master of Norwich Grammar School, in place of the Rev. Dr.
Jessopp, on his presentation to the rectory of Scarning.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The marriage of William Heveagre Legge, Viscount
Lewisham, Member of Parliament for West Kent, eldest son of the
Earl of Dartmouth, with Lady Mary Coke, fourth daughter of the
Earl of Leicester, took place at Holkham.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Died at Threxton, aged 68, Mr. Thomas Edward Walter
Barton.&nbsp; The Watton and Thetford Railway was originated
mainly through Mr. Barton&rsquo;s instrumentality.&nbsp; His
favourite study was arch&aelig;ology, and he possessed a valuable
antiquarian collection and library.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Christmas pantomime produced at Norwich Theatre
by Mr. R. Hall was entitled, &ldquo;Aladdin the Great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died at his residence, Upper Surrey Street, Norwich,
aged 68, Mr. Thomas Brightwell, a well-known solicitor, and clerk
to the Charity Trustees, in which office he was succeeded by Mr.
E. S. Bignold.</p>
<h3>1880.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>17.&mdash;Died at St. Giles&rsquo; Street, Norwich, in his
63rd year, Mr. Arthur Morris Foster Morgan, surgeon.&nbsp; He was
third son of Mr. Richard Morgan, actuary of the Norwich Union
Life Insurance Society, and after completing his professional
studies was appointed medical-officer of the Norwich Dispensary,
a post which he relinquished on entering into private
practice.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan was president of the Board of
Directors of the Norwich Equitable Fire Insurance Company, and
held several other public appointments.&nbsp; For twenty years he
was a member of the Corporation, and for some time was an
alderman of the city.&nbsp; In polities he was a Liberal.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at his residence, Stradsett Hall, near Downham
Market, Sir William Bagge, Bart., M.P.&nbsp; One of twins born on
June 17th, 1810, he was a son of Mr. Thomas Philip Bagge, and
priority of birth entitled him to the family estates, to which he
succeeded on the death of his father, on June 30th, 1827.&nbsp;
In 1833 he married Frances, <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>fourth daughter of Sir Thomas
Preston, Bart., of Beeston Hall, and two years after made his
entry into public life by acceding to a request to contest the
Parliamentary representation of West Norfolk, which had hitherto
been in undisturbed possession of the Whigs.&nbsp; In this first
attempt to break down the political monopoly exercised in the
division Mr. Bagge was unsuccessful; three years subsequently,
however, he and Mr. Chute were returned.&nbsp; In 1841 he and his
colleague were returned unopposed.&nbsp; In 1847 the Liberals
made another attempt, and succeeded in electing one of their
candidates, the Hon. E. K. Coke, but were unable to displace Mr.
Bagge from his position.&nbsp; In 1852 Mr. Bagge was joined by
Mr. G. W. P. Bentinck, and the contest resulted in an easy
victory over Mr. Hamond.&nbsp; It was deemed advisable by both
sides in 1857 to have a compromise, and Mr. Bagge, &ldquo;from
private reasons, and a desire not to disturb the peace of the
county,&rdquo; retired to make room for Mr. Gurdon, who, with Mr.
Bentinck, thereafter represented the division.&nbsp; At the
General Election in 1865 the Conservatives resolved to take the
entire representation, and Mr. Bentinck&rsquo;s state of health
not allowing him to undertake the fatigue of a contest, Mr. Bagge
was asked to come forward with the Hon. T. de Grey.&nbsp; The
result was a large increase of Conservative strength and the
return of both candidates.&nbsp; In 1867 the honour of a
baronetcy was conferred upon Mr. Bagge, in recognition of his
valuable political services.&nbsp; Sir William was succeeded by
his eldest son, William Henry Ernest, who was born in 1840.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;A public meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, Norwich, for the purpose of making known in the county the
aims and objects of the Farmers&rsquo; Alliance.&nbsp; Mr. Henry
Birkbeck presided, and it was asserted that the society was
non-political.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything passed smoothly until the
hon. member for South Norfolk, Mr. C. S. Read, ventured to take a
different view from that of preceding speakers, and he was
subjected to persistent interruption by certain well-known
Liberal politicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. J. Howard, president of the
Alliance, and Mr. J. W. Barclay, M.P. for Forfarshire, were among
the speakers.</p>

Shirehall, Norwich, on the 7th.&nbsp; &ldquo;The result of the
first count was a dead heat between Mr. Read and Mr. Gurdon, the
numbers for both being 2,906.&nbsp; Mr. Read&rsquo;s agent
demanded a second count, and on the clerks going through the
papers, one of them discovered a voting-paper for Buxton and
Read, on the back of which the voter, in distinct violation of
the Ballot Act, had inscribed his name.&nbsp; The rejection of
this paper made the numbers as between Mr. Read and Mr. Gurdon
2,905 and 2,906.&nbsp; Thus the seat was lost by one vote, and
the official return was made as follows; Buxton, 2,917; Gurdon,
2,906; Read, 2905.&rdquo;&nbsp; A proposed petition against the

<p>21.&mdash;A meeting was held at the Royal Hotel, Norwich,
under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. H. Bullard), in
furtherance of the proposed new line of railway between Lynn,
Fakenham, and Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Walrond Smith, C.E., stated the
details of the scheme, and a committee was appointed to promote
the progress of a Bill before Parliament.&nbsp; The Corporation
of Norwich had previously presented a petition against the
railway, but, on the promoters giving an undertaking to construct
a new road from Barn Road to a point in St. Martin-at-Oak Street,
to be carried over the Wensum by a bridge, the Town Council, on
May 26th, consented to the withdrawal of the petition.&nbsp;
Before the end of the year a more elaborate scheme was submitted
by the promoters, who suggested an extension of the line beyond
the intended terminus at North Heigham.&nbsp; It was to cross the
Wensum and pass beneath the Fakenham and Aylsham turnpikes to the
hamlet of Pockthorpe, to be again carried over the river near
Bishop Bridge, and to pass through the Lower Close and St.
Faith&rsquo;s Lane to the Prince of Wales Road, where it was
proposed to erect a central station for the accommodation of
passengers, goods, and cattle.&nbsp; Application was made to the
Corporation to contribute &pound;50,000 towards the cost of the
land required for this undertaking.&nbsp; The matter was
considered at a meeting of the Town Council on December 21st,
when the proposals generally, and the suggested contribution in
particular, were ridiculed.&nbsp; The Dean of Norwich, on behalf
of the Cathedral body and the inhabitants of the Close, wrote an
indignant protest against the contemplated intrusion upon their
privacy and injury to their property.&nbsp; The subject was
referred to the Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee, who, in due
course, condemned the scheme.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 31st,
1882.)</p>

Faith&rsquo;s Lane be discontinued, and the boys transferred to
the Workhouse, and that the Home be offered for sale.&nbsp; Canon
Copeman moved that it was desirable to provide education and
industrial training for the children of the poor apart from the
Workhouse.&nbsp; The amendment was adopted by 24 votes against
12.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;The centenary anniversary of the Yarmouth Monthly
Book Club was celebrated by a dinner held at the Crown and Anchor
Hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;In former days the custom was for each member
present at the dinner to propose the health of a lady.&nbsp; The
society was promoted by the Rev. Richard Turner, afterwards vicar
of the parish, who, at the first meeting, was elected honorary
secretary, and held that office fifty years.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by Dr. G. Penrice, who was followed by the Rev. Mark
Waters, B.A., in 1841.&nbsp; After the decease of that gentleman,
in 1864, the business was conducted by the Rev. Bowyer Vaux, who,
five years ago, resigned, and was succeeded by Mr. J. F.
Waters.&nbsp; The club is remarkable for its age, for having had
during its century of existence only five secretaries, and for
being still as flourishing as it was in its early
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12.&mdash;A special meeting of the Norwich Diocesan
Conference, summoned by requisition, was held at Noverre&rsquo;s
Rooms, Norwich, to consider the Burials Bill introduced by the
Government.&nbsp; The Conference adopted resolutions protesting
against the principle of the Bill, and suggesting certain
amendments thereto, the chief of which were that its provisions
should not extend to the consecrated parts of cemeteries nor to
churchyards to which land had been added by living donors, and
that the permissive clause as to the modification of services be
omitted.</p>

<p>&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, the corporate
seal was affixed to an agreement between the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners for England and the Corporation, for carrying into
effect the arrangement made in 1866 with the Dean and Chapter of
Norwich for conveying Mousehold Heath to the Corporation for the
purpose of public pleasure grounds.&nbsp; The proposal met with
strenuous opposition from the inhabitants of Pockthorpe, who
claimed the Heath as the property of themselves and their
successors, and asserted that while they were entitled to the
rents, rights, and profits, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had
no title whatever.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> June 21st, 1881.)</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The Summer Show of the Norfolk Agricultural
Association was held at Downham Market, and was continued on the

an influential meeting held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, on behalf
of the Eastern Counties&rsquo; Asylum for Idiots.&nbsp; The

his Grace was received at the hall by the Mayor (Mr. Harry
Bullard), the Sheriff (Mr. Philip Back), the Deputy Mayor.&nbsp;
(Mr. J. D. Smith), and other civic dignitaries.&nbsp; The Mayor

Volunteers went into camp at Great Yarmouth, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Bulwer and Lieut.-Colonel Gurdon, M.P.&nbsp; The
total number of men under canvas was 1,301.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council, on the motion of Mr.
George White, adopted the following resolution: &ldquo;Several
months having elapsed since this Council requested the
Parliamentary and Bylaws Committee to consider the legal position
in which the Corporation stands with the British Gaslight
Company, and, considering the enormous interests at stake, the
Council urges upon the Committee the necessity of at once
reporting as to what steps, if any, they advise to be taken, in
order to relieve the citizens from the unjust and unnecessary
burdens imposed upon them through the extravagant charge <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>made for
gas.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Committee were also instructed &ldquo;to
take into consideration the question of electric lighting, as
lately adopted by several corporations.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

<p>27.&mdash;A grand bazaar was held in Holkham Park, in aid of
the restoration fund of Wells church.&nbsp; The proceedings
realised a profit of &pound;845.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Died at Castle Rising, the Hon. Theophilus Howard,
second son of Charles John, Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire.&nbsp;
Mr. Howard entered into possession of the estate of Castle Rising
at the close of 1876, having received it by deed of gift from
Mrs. Howard, of Ashstead.&nbsp; By his succession this property,
which came into the possession of the Howard family in 1545,
again reverted to the Suffolk and Berkshire line, from which it
was separated by the death of Henry, twelfth Earl of Suffolk and
Berkshire, in the year 1779.&nbsp; Mr. Howard married Lady Audrey
Townshend, youngest daughter of the Marquis Townshend, in 1873,
and left two sons and two daughters.&nbsp; He was called to the
Bar in 1863, and in 1873 was appointed a Commissioner in Lunacy,
a post which he resigned in 1878.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was the first
of the great Howard family who made Castle Rising his permanent
residence and home, for though the estate had been possessed by
the Howards since 1545 it was always as a political occupation
when Castle Rising was a Parliamentary borough, or as a temporary
residence for the shooting.&nbsp; Consequently, through the long
period of 335 years not one of the family is known to have died
there, and certainly none, with the exception of Mr. Howard, have
been buried in the parish church or churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;At the Norwich Police Court, William Davies, of the
Army Hospital Corps, Henry Pritchard, and William Solly, privates
in the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and Staff-Sergt. Alexander W.
Browne, Army Hospital Corps, were charged with attempting to kill
and murder John Smith, a private of the 17th Regiment of Foot, at
the Cavalry Barracks, on August 3rd.&nbsp; Smith had been left in
the military hospital by a detachment of the 17th, who had handed
the barracks over to the Inniskillings.&nbsp; Smith was suffering
from a loathsome disease, and it was alleged that the orderlies
of the dragoons and Davies, who had charge of him, with the
cognisance of Browne, stuffed up the fireplace of the ward with
straw, closed the windows and door, and placed plates of burning
sulphur upon the floor, for the purpose of suffocating him.&nbsp;
The man died a few days subsequently from the effects of the
disease from which he was suffering.&nbsp; The prosecution
alleged two motives against the prisoners&mdash;first, that some
of them were interested in a will made by Smith in their favour,
and, secondly, that they were desirous of getting rid of an
unpleasant patient.&nbsp; After several remands, the prisoners
were committed for trial at the Assizes.&nbsp; The case was heard
before the Lord Chief Justice on November 12th, when the jury
acquitted the prisoners.&nbsp; Sergt. Browne was shortly
afterwards promoted to the post of Acting Sergt.-Major in the
Army Hospital Corps at the North Camp, Aldershot, and headmaster
of the 3rd District Station Hospital.</p>

the Local Government Board, held an inquiry at the Guildhall as
to an application by the Corporation for powers to borrow
&pound;30,300 for street improvements and wood paving.&nbsp; It

required for the latter work.&nbsp; The Town Clerk reported, on
November 16th, that the Local Government Board had sanctioned a
loan of &pound;25,000, repayable with interest within a period
not exceeding twelve years.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 22nd,

the trustees, was instructed to attend a Select Committee of the
House of Commons, to give information on the subject.&nbsp; This
resulted in a further period of five years being granted, and
certain restrictions and conditions were imposed to be observed
by the trustees.&nbsp; It was only in 1824 an Act was obtained
for making this road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under no conditions, however,
can the trust be maintained beyond November 1st, 1881, and
therefore after that date the Wells and Fakenham Turnpike Trust

bring an action in connection with the Harvey and Hudsons
bankruptcy.&nbsp; It was alleged that a certain asset of the firm
(a life interest on property which had been sold by Mr. E. K.
Harvey to his brother, Sir Robert) was disposed of for a sum far
below its value; Messrs. Boswell and Baxter, wine merchants, who
were creditors of Messrs. Harvey and Hudsons, claimed that the
matter should be re-opened and re-adjusted.&nbsp; Divested of
technicalities, the claim of the plaintiffs, who sued for
themselves and other creditors of Sir R. J. Harvey&rsquo;s joint
and separate estates, was to have the purchase of the life
interest by the defendants set aside, and to have the benefit of
the policies effected, and payment of the income arising from the
life interest which had been already received by the defendants,
after allowance had been made for the purchase-money and interest

suit.&nbsp; The Master of the Rolls granted the application to
December 9th.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> December 7th, 1882.)</p>

frost, and the wind, which during the preceding night had veered

raged for nearly twenty-four hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;A velocity of
548 miles was recorded, a force very rarely experienced in this
part of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little snow fell until about

themselves with a virulence almost unprecedented.&nbsp; From six
to eight inches of snow fell in a few hours, and in places there
were drifts ten feet in depth.&nbsp; The traffic on most of the
branch lines of the Great Eastern Railway was suspended nearly
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; The mail train from Norwich to
Yarmouth&mdash;four hours late&mdash;ran into a drift near

engines and the efforts of sixty men proved unavailing, and there
was no alternative but to take the train back to Norwich.&nbsp;
Many of the roads being impassable, the mail-cart drivers
abandoned their journeys.&nbsp; Terrible shipping disasters
occurred off Yarmouth; thirteen vessels were wrecked, and nearly
fifty lives lost.&nbsp; The surf lifeboat was capsized a few

<p>28.&mdash;In accordance with a resolution adopted at a meeting
of the Norfolk Chamber of Agriculture on the 26th, a deputation
waited upon Earl Spencer, President of the Privy Council, when
Mr. C. S. Read, as president of the Chamber and Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the County, expressed, on behalf of
Norfolk agriculturists, the desire that, in view of the
prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease, greater restrictions should
be observed in regard to store cattle, and that a certain
relaxation should be made in the case of fat cattle, which, it
was proposed, should be sent direct from licensed sales and
markets to slaughter-houses, to be killed within four days.&nbsp;
It was also suggested that the Privy Council should prohibit the
importation of live animals from countries where they knew
disease existed.&nbsp; A further deputation, headed by the Mayor
of Norwich (Mr. S. Grimmer), interviewed Earl Spencer on March
25th, with the view of obtaining such relaxation of the Orders in
Council as to permit the sale of store stock at Tombland
Fair.&nbsp; A fresh outbreak of the disease occurred in the
autumn, and on October 28th the county authority passed a
resolution affirming that, notwithstanding its recurrence, the
time had not arrived for the closing of the markets; that should
the Privy Council consider it necessary to stop the spread of the
disease by closing the store stock markets, such order should not
take effect before the first week in December; that the existing
regulations for preventing the importation of diseased cattle
from foreign countries were entirely insufficient, and that until
more stringent regulations were in force the system of closing
markets was vexatious.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 7th, 1882.)</p>

cleverness he possessed, and constructed a perforating machine
similar to those now in use.&nbsp; This success was made known to
his employers, who presented him with a sum for the invention,
but obtained the credit for it, and also the large reward
offered.&nbsp; The inventor gained a competency by his industry,

sister.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;At the Guildhall Police Court, Norwich, Mr. Joseph
Stanley, solicitor, was charged, on the information of Edward
Burgess, described as a printer and publisher, with assaulting
him.&nbsp; The defendant, it was alleged, met the complainant in
London Street, and, producing a riding-whip from beneath his
coat, struck him several blows across the face.&nbsp; The assault
was admitted, and defendant pleaded, in mitigation, that he
horsewhipped the complainant in consequence of certain statements
published by him in a paper called &ldquo;Daylight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Bench inflicted a fine of one shilling, and declined to make
an order as to costs.&nbsp; This was the first of a remarkable
series of cases arising directly or indirectly from the
publication of the print above referred to.&nbsp; At Norwich
County Court, on February 21st, before the Judge (Mr. E. P.
Price, Q.C.) and a jury, William Hammond, &ldquo;otherwise E.
Field and Co.,&rdquo; brought an action against Edward Burgees
and J. A. Burgis, the proprietors of &ldquo;Daylight,&rdquo; for
an alleged libel.&nbsp; The action was originally entered for
trial in the High Court of Justice, the plaintiff laying his
damages at &pound;1,000, but it was remitted to the County Court,
on the application of the defendants, on the plaintiff failing to
give security for costs.&nbsp; Mr. Horace Brown was for the
plaintiff (who did not appear), and Mr. Montague Williams for the
defendants.&nbsp; The case was partly heard when Mr. Brown said
that, having regard to what had transpired, he did not think it
right to ask the jury for damages.&nbsp; A verdict was therefore
entered for the defendants.&nbsp; On February 24th, Arthur
Ventnor, artist, of Bridewell Alley, was charged at the Police
Court with wilfully breaking the plate-glass windows at the
office of &ldquo;Daylight,&rdquo; and doing damage to the amount
of &pound;20.&nbsp; The defendant was committed for trial at the
Quarter Sessions, held on April 3rd, before the Recorder (Mr. W.
J. Metcalfe, Q.C.).&nbsp; It was urged on behalf of the defendant
that he had broken the windows owing to a caricature of himself
being exhibited therein.&nbsp; The Grand Jury made the following
presentment: &ldquo;We consider that considerable provocation was
given to Mr. Ventnor by the exhibition of the caricature before
he broke the windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Recorder, who deplored the
publication of such a paper, addressing the defendant, said,
&ldquo;The sentence of the Court is that you be imprisoned for
three hours, which means that you have been in the dock a great
deal too long already, and that you now be discharged.&nbsp; Who
is to pay the costs of this prosecution?&nbsp; Not the public,
certainly, but the people who provoke other people to smash their
windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The verdict was received with great
applause by a crowded court.&nbsp; At the Police Court on April
23rd, Messrs. Burgess and Burgis appeared in answer to an
information laid by Lewin Samuel, clothier, of St. Giles&rsquo;
Street, for publishing in &ldquo;Daylight&rdquo; a defamatory
libel of and concerning him.&nbsp; This was a criminal
prosecution, on the fiat of the Public Prosecutor.&nbsp; The
defendants alleged in their paper that the complainant and his
brother were &ldquo;Jew money-lenders, who sold up the homes of
hard-working men and the <a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>beds from under women and children,
and extorted 150 per cent. and more, interests for small
loans.&rdquo;&nbsp; The case was sent for trial at the
Assizes.&nbsp; The defendants appeared before Mr. Justice Day, on
August 9th.&nbsp; After the case had been part heard, Mr. Horace
Brown, counsel for the prosecution, asked leave to
withdraw.&nbsp; His lordship granted the request, and remarked
that Mr. Brown&rsquo;s client &ldquo;had attained his object in
having the character of his business thoroughly exposed to the
public.&rdquo;&nbsp; The defendants were then discharged.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The trial of the action.&nbsp; Boswell <i>v.</i>
Coaks, commenced before Mr. Justice Fry.&nbsp; On the fifth day
of the trial, March 12th, his lordship gave judgment.&nbsp; In
his opinion, he said, the plaintiff&rsquo;s case had failed, and
he dismissed the action, with costs.&nbsp; Later in the day the
judge remarked that there was a certain point in the case which
he had not appreciated, and ordered the action to be restored to
the paper as part heard.&nbsp; At the further hearing, on March
19th, his lordship said he adhered to the view which he
previously expressed, and pronounced judgment unreservedly in
favour of the defendants, who were entirely acquitted of the
charge against them.&nbsp; On June 19th an appeal was entered
against the decision of Mr. Justice Fry.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> May
19th, 1884.)</p>

soon woke up, and immediately one of his admirers, in the form of
a &lsquo;working-man,&rsquo; proceeded to the carriage window and
introduced himself as one of his supporters, and thereupon shook
hands with the Premier.&nbsp; On Sunday morning (April 1st), some

when that regiment was stationed in Norwich in 1840, and formed
an attachment for a young lady residing in the Close, whose

anticipated the career which lay before the disdained young
sergeant-major.&nbsp; Though in the ranks, he was the son of a
Liverpool merchant.&nbsp; He won his honours and promotion in the

prisoner had no real intention to take any step towards carrying
out his threat, and was desirous that the case should be
withdrawn.&nbsp; The judge said that his lordship had acted in a
very handsome and generous manner, and allowed the prosecution to
be withdrawn on the prisoner entering into recognisances to keep
the peace towards the Bishop and all other persons.&nbsp; At the
Norwich Police Court on September 21st Betts was charged with
knowingly, wilfully, and feloniously sending to Mr. J. J. Colman,
M.P., a letter, signed &ldquo;Another Invincible,&rdquo;
threatening to murder him &ldquo;unless he fairly and
proportionately distributed his last year&rsquo;s balance among
his workmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was committed for trial, and at the
Assizes on October 27th was sentenced by Lord Justice Fry to
twelve calendar months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

<p>11.&mdash;The scheme prepared by the Charity Commissioners for
the future management of the endowed schools and children&rsquo;s
hospitals in connection with King Edward VI.&rsquo;s charity and
Anguish&rsquo;s and Norman&rsquo;s charities, was
published.&nbsp; The scheme for the Grammar and Commercial
Schools was practically the same as those promulgated in
1878.&nbsp; In the matter of Anguish&rsquo;s charity, it was
proposed to divide the endowment into two parts, one to be called
Thomas Anguish&rsquo;s endowment for boys, and the other Thomas
Anguish&rsquo;s endowment for girls.&nbsp; The existing
boys&rsquo; school was to be given up, the master pensioned, and
the income devoted, so far as &pound;200 yearly was concerned, to
providing lodging, clothing, and maintenance for boys holding
exhibitions preferentially awarded under the scheme.&nbsp; With
the rest of the income the governors were to maintain seven
special exhibitions for poor boys who for not less than three
years had been scholars in some public elementary school or
schools, and as many general exhibitions for poor boys as the
income available would allow to be tenable at either of King
Edward VI. schools.&nbsp; As to Thomas Anguish&rsquo;s endowment
for girls, the girls&rsquo; hospital was to be abolished and the
income applied in the same way as that for boys, except that
&pound;300 yearly was to be devoted to providing lodging,
clothing, and maintenance for orphan or other necessitous
girls.&nbsp; Norman&rsquo;s charity was to cease to exist in its
then form, the master pensioned, and the endowment to be
appropriated to the maintenance of a girls&rsquo; middle school,
the scheme for which was practically the same as that for the
King Edward VI.&nbsp; Middle School for Boys, and to be known as
Norman&rsquo;s School, provision being made for the acquisition
by purchase of the Girls&rsquo; Hospital School at Lakenham by
the new governors of the Norman School.&nbsp; On August 28th the
Norwich Town Council passed resolutions in opposition to the
scheme, on the ground that it was contrary to the wishes of the
founders and of the people of Norwich; and similar resolutions
were carried at a meeting of the Norwich Charities Protection
Society held at the Guildhall on September 10th, under the
presidency of the Sheriff.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> February 3rd,
1888.)</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Miss Maude Branscombe and her London company

<p>&mdash;The Norfolk acid Norwich Hospital was opened by the
Duke and Duchess of Connaught upon its completion.&nbsp; The
actual expenditure to this date had been &pound;51,179, of which

&pound;10,192 was withdrawn from invested capital, and
&pound;2,569 was advanced to the treasurer by Messrs. Gurney and
Co.&nbsp; To <a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

received at Thorpe Station by the Mayor (Mr. C. R. Gilman), the
Sheriff (Mr. S. Newman), the Deputy-Mayor (Mr. W. Hunter), the
Earl of Leicester, and other representatives of the
Hospital.&nbsp; His Royal Highness, after replying to an address
read by the Town Clerk, drove with the Duchess through the gaily
decorated streets of the city to the Hospital, where Prince
Albert Victor had arrived some time previously from Horstead Hall
in company with Mr. Edward Birkbeck, M.P.&nbsp; After the formal
opening of the building their Royal Highnesses visited the
various departments, and attended a grand bazaar held in the
grounds; and later in the afternoon proceeded to Cotton Hall as
the guests of Mr. S. Gurney Buxton and Miss Buxton.&nbsp; On the
morning of the 21st their Royal Highnesses visited the Cathedral,
and left for London at 2.55 p.m.&nbsp; The Hospital bazaar, which
remained open until the 25th, produced net receipts amounting to
&pound;5,779 5s. 3d.</p>

Wighton, Mr. Charles, Mr. Tickell, and Mr. Methold, held the
vicarage for no less than 143 years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Methold
played for Harrow in the first cricket match which that school
won against Eton.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died, at his residence, Ber Street House, Norwich,
Mr. John May Robberds, of the firm of Fosters, Burroughes, and

<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;At Norwich Police Court, Mr. William Sidney,
proprietor of the <a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>Theatre Royal, made application for a licence for the
performance of stage plays in that building.&nbsp; He stated that
it was fifty years since he first performed at the Theatre, when,
under the management of Mr. Davenport, it was open all the year
round, and was understood to be a patent theatre.&nbsp; It was
afterwards purchased by a company of which Sir William Foster and
Mr. Robberds were the chairmen.&nbsp; He (Mr. Sidney) became
lessee and afterwards proprietor, and purchased the shares and
freehold land.&nbsp; The understanding during all those years was
that it was a patent theatre and required no licence from the
magistrates.&nbsp; The Town Clerk had requested him to produce
the patent, but neither he nor his solicitors (Messrs. Rackham)
were able to do so.&nbsp; Eventually a patent was found, but to
their great surprise it was granted to one Thomas Ivory for seven
months in the year only, commencing November 1st.&nbsp; The Town
Clerk explained to the magistrates that the attention of the
Executive Committee of the Corporation having been called to the
necessity of certain structural alterations at the Theatre, Mr.
Sidney was requested to have them carried out, and in consequence
of his non-compliance the Lord Chamberlain was communicated with,
and then it appeared that no patent had been granted to a theatre
in Norwich since 1768.&nbsp; The magistrates, before granting the
licence, required Mr. Sidney to comply with the demands of the
Corporation, and on the 19th, it being reported that the work was
completed, his application was acceded to.</p>

<h3>1884.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A great meeting of Norfolk farmers was held at the
Agricultural Hall, Norwich, at which was passed a series of
resolutions affirming that they viewed with alarm the serious
loss imposed upon the nation by the importation of live stock
from countries where foot and mouth disease was known to exist,
and calling upon the Government to order the withdrawal of
existing restrictions on the removal of stock in England.&nbsp;
On the 29th a similar meeting, presided over by Lord Walsingham,
was held at Lynn, and a third meeting took place at Fakenham on
the 31st.&nbsp; Deputations from the Corporations of Norwich and
Lynn waited upon the local authority at Norwich on February 23rd
to discuss what steps should be taken to effect the re-opening of
the cattle markets in the city and borough, and it was decided to
send a deputation to the Privy Council.&nbsp; This deputation,
consisting of representatives of the county authority, and of the
Corporations of Norwich and Lynn, waited upon Lord Carlingford on
February 28th, and asked for the immediate opening of the markets
and the removal or modification of other restrictions.&nbsp; At
the quarterly meeting of the county magistrates on April 10th,
Mr. C. S. Read, M.P., reported that the sum of &pound;2,586 had

Fiddaman.&nbsp; He began life in very humble circumstances and
without the advantages afforded by education.&nbsp; The son of a
tailor in a small way of business, he first acted as an assistant
to his uncle, who was ostler at a tavern in Lynn.&nbsp; He was
afterwards ostler or &ldquo;boots&rdquo; at inns and hotels in
neighbouring towns; subsequently he tramped the country for a
time, visiting London, Brighton, and other places in quest of a
good situation.&nbsp; Eventually he returned to Lynn, took a
public-house known as the Wheatsheaf, in Norfolk Street, and made
it the local centre of the sporting interest in West
Norfolk.&nbsp; After a time he bought the house, converted it
into an hotel and wine vaults, and rapidly made a fortune.&nbsp;
Mr. Fiddaman was a munificent donor to many benevolent
institutions, and his private acts of charity were
numerous.&nbsp; An enormous concourse of persons attended his
funeral.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died, at his residence, Thorpe St. Andrew, Mr.
Richard Noverre Bacon, aged 85, probably the oldest journalist in
the kingdom.&nbsp; At an early age he was engaged in newspaper
work under his father, Richard <a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Mackenzie Bacon, whom in 1845 he
succeeded as proprietor and editor of the &ldquo;Norwich
Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Whig of the old school, Mr. Bacon in his
editorship of the &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; was tenacious in the
maintenance of his opinions, and held them with a firmness which
did not always please the more advanced section of the Liberal
party&mdash;hence the establishment of the &ldquo;Norfolk
News&rdquo; as the representative organ of Liberal Nonconformity
in county and city.&nbsp; Mr. Bacon served his fellow-citizens in
the Town Council, on the Hospital board, and in other capacities,
and assisted in founding the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Sick
Children.&nbsp; As a journalist he was decidedly inferior to his
distinguished father, and his only literary work was his
&ldquo;Essay on Norfolk Agriculture,&rdquo; written in 1844,
which won for him the prize offered by the Royal Agricultural
Society, besides bringing him prominently forward among the
agriculturists of the county, a connection he was assiduous in
maintaining to the close of his career.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>19.&mdash;A deputation of Norfolk magistrates and members of
the Norwich Town Council waited upon the Home Secretary (Sir
William Harcourt) on the subject of the proposed provision of a
new prison site at Norwich.&nbsp; Lord Walsingham explained the
objects of the deputation.&nbsp; The county prison at Norwich,
with the Castle and a portion of the ground on which it stands,
having been offered under Section 34 of the Prisons Act, 1877,
for re-purchase by the original prison authority, <i>i.e.</i>,
the county of Norfolk, at the statutory price fixed by the Act
(amounting in this case to &pound;10,569), a committee was
appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions for the county, and
another committee by the Town Council of Norwich.&nbsp; The
county authority would not consent to take money out of the
pockets of the heavily-burdened ratepayers for the repurchase of
property which they had been compelled by law to part with for
nothing; but they asked that this ancient and interesting piece
of county property should be restored to its original owners
&ldquo;that it might be by them preserved to the best advantage
in all its imposing dignity and grandeur.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor
of Norwich (Dr. Eade) stated that Mr. John Gurney had gone so far
as to offer, free of cost, another site for a prison.&nbsp; The
Home Secretary replied that the Prison Commissioners would not
abandon the site, but would continue to occupy it, unless an
offer were made which they could accept.&nbsp; If it was desired
that they should go elsewhere, it should be made worth their
while to do so.&nbsp; At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council on
April 10th it was reported that the Home Secretary was willing to
accept &pound;5,000 for the Castle, and that a still further
reduction was probable.&nbsp; On June 17th the Mayor announced to
the Corporation that the Government had agreed to sell to the
city the Castle and its environments for &pound;4,000; and it was
resolved to purchase the property for that sum.&nbsp; (<i>See</i>

<p>20.&mdash;Mr. C. S. Read was returned unopposed to fill the
vacancy in the representation of the Western Division of the
county, caused by the resignation of Mr. Bentinck, M.P.&nbsp; Mr.
Read took his seat in the House of Commons on the 21st, and had a
very cordial reception.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Premier shook his hand
when he came to the table, and a score of members behind the
chair greeted him as heartily.&rdquo;</p>

hours (Sundays and Christmas Day excluded), delivered a lecture
at the Agricultural Hall, Norwich, on &ldquo;How I Came to Walk
into Walking.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor (Dr. Eade) presided.&nbsp;
Weston, whose address was in the cause of temperance, stated that
in fourteen years he had walked 56,000 miles.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Norwich of the death,

<p>19.&mdash;In the Court of Appeal, Lords Justices Baggallay,
Cotton, and Lindley commenced the hearing of the appeal case,
Boswell and others <i>v.</i> Coaks and others.&nbsp; This was an

by Mr. J. F. Boswell and Mr. James Baxter on behalf of themselves
and of other unsatisfied creditors of Sir Robert John Harvey,

arguments of counsel and examination of witnesses in the appeal
occupied the time of the Court for nine days, and it is just over
six weeks since the case closed and their lordships announced
that they would consider their judgment.&nbsp; It amounts to a
complete vindication of the action taken by the plaintiffs, for

Maria, daughter of Mr. Effingham Laurence, of New York.&nbsp;
Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a

freemen be paid as usual.&rdquo;&nbsp; The amendment was defeated

injunction to restrain the Corporation from admitting to the
freedom of the city by servitude any persons who had served only
under articles of clerkship to a solicitor for not exceeding five
years, and had not served seven years&rsquo; apprenticeship to a
freeman trader.&nbsp; The Corporation was also desired to furnish
an account of all persons so admitted from September 9th, 1835,
it being contended by the freemen that the profession of law was
not a trade or business as required by the Act, and that no man
could be admitted under less than a seven years&rsquo;
apprenticeship.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 21st, 1887.)</p>

Henry James Lee Warner.&nbsp; He was born at Stanton St. Quintin,
Wiltshire, where his father was then curate.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards his grandfather succeeded to the Walsingham Abbey
estates, and in 1807 his father accepted the charge of the
adjoining parishes of Walsingham and Houghton-in-the-Dale.&nbsp;
Having attended Aylsham Grammar School he proceeded to Rugby, and
thence to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where, in 1825, he
took double honours in classics and mathematics, being fourth
Senior Optime and in the second class of the Classical
Tripos.&nbsp; After residing at the Temple and reading for the
Bar, he travelled for some time on the Continent, and on
returning to England read for Holy Orders, and was ordained at
Norwich by Bishop Bathurst.&nbsp; Mr. Lee Warner first held a
curacy at Canterbury, and in 1834 succeeded his father in the
parishes of Great and Little Walsingham and
Houghton-in-the-Dale.&nbsp; From conscientious motives he
resigned his plurality of livings and thenceforth devoted himself
to the more populous parish of Little Walsingham on a stipend of
&pound;100 per annum.&nbsp; Mr. Lee Warner largely identified
himself with Church work in the diocese, and in 1863 was
appointed an Honorary Canon of Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp; He was a
well-known arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man of singular
modesty, of simple faith and self-denying habits, he was not only
a strong teetotaller by conviction, but also in many ways opposed
to what he considered excessive luxury.&rdquo;</p>

Adams, rector of Saham Toney, had on Sunday, July 26th,
pronounced in his parish church sentence of excommunication
against Joseph Payne, a parishioner, aged 82, because of his
persistent neglect of the Church&rsquo;s ordinances and refusal
of her ministrations, and enquired whether notice would be taken
of his illegal action?&nbsp; Sir Richard Cross replied that he
saw this account with extreme surprise and regret, and he thought
it right the sentence should be sent to the Bishop, who, he had
no doubt, would make enquiry into the matter.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Died, at Rackheath Park, Sir Henry Josias Stracey,
Bart.&nbsp; A prominent member of a well-known county family, Sir
Henry for many years occupied a distinguished position.&nbsp;
Born in 1802, he was educated at Eton, and afterwards served for
several years in the 1st Dragoons, and on succeeding to the
baronetcy, on the death of his father in 1855, he entered with
considerable ardour into politics.&nbsp; Just previously he had
been returned without opposition as one of the representatives of
East Norfolk on the retirement of Mr. Edmond Wodehouse.&nbsp; On
the dissolution of Parliament in 1857 Major-General Windham, in
the flush of the fame he had gained in the Crimea, was brought
forward for East Norfolk with Sir E. N. Buxton, and there being
divided opinions in the Conservative camp, Mr. Burroughes and Sir
Henry Stracey declined to contest the seat.&nbsp; On the death of
Sir E. N. Buxton in June, 1858, Sir Henry was again nominated,
and was defeated by the Hon. Wenman Coke.&nbsp; In the following
year he was returned with Sir Edmund Lacon for Yarmouth,
defeating Mr. (afterwards Sir E. W.) Watkin and Mr. Young, and
sat for that borough until 1865.&nbsp; In 1868 he stood for
Norwich in opposition to Sir W. Russell and Mr. Tillett, and was
returned at the head of the poll, but was unseated on
petition.&nbsp; In 1874 he again came forward, in conjunction
with Mr. Huddleston, was unsuccessful, and thereafter took no
share in polities.&nbsp; Sir Henry married, in 1835, Charlotte,
only daughter and heiress of Mr. George Denne, of the Paddock,
Canterbury.&nbsp; He served the office of High Sheriff in 1871,
and was a Deputy Lieutenant and magistrate for the county of
Norfolk.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died, at Hingham, Sir Thomas Beevor, Bart., aged
61.&nbsp; He married, on December 19th, 1850, Sophia Jane,
daughter of the Rev. Clement Chevallier, rector of Badington and
Cransford, Suffolk, and widow of Mr. Isaac Jermy Jermy, who, with
his father, Mr. Isaac Jermy, fell a victim to the murderer, James
Blomfield Rush.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Beevor family, which, with their
connections, are very numerous, are descended from the Rev.
William Beevor, rector of South Walsham and Rockland in 1659 (the
eldest son of Abraham Beevor, of Heckmondwike, Yorkshire), whose
grandson, Sir Thomas, eldest son of Thomas Beevor, of Norwich,
and Hester, daughter of John Sharpe, of Norwich, was created a
baronet in 1784.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subject of this notice was
educated for the Bar, but in his latter years devoted himself to
the supervision of the business of the Norwich Union Life
Assurance Society, of which he was chairman of the directors, and
was at the same time a director of the Norwich Union Fire
Office.&nbsp; His eldest son, Thomas Edward, died to 1879, and
the second son, Hugh Reeve, succeeded to the baronetcy.</p>

of the school, a position which he held for many years before his

15th.&nbsp; He was found guilty and sentenced to death.&nbsp; The
execution took place at Norwich Castle on November 30th.&nbsp;
Berry, of Bradford, was the executioner.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the
clock of an adjacent church struck the hour of eight, Berry, who
was stationed behind the prisoner with the lever in his hand,
asked him, &lsquo;Do you wish to say anything else before you
go?&rsquo; to which Goodale replied in the negative, and before
the eighth stroke had sounded, the lever was pulled, the
trap-door fell, and the prisoner, who weighed 15 stone, and was 5
ft. 11 in. in height, and was allowed a drop just short of six
feet, disappeared from view.&nbsp; To the horror of the
bystanders the rope rebounded, and it was thought that by some
means it had become <a name="page362"></a><span

the pit below the scaffold the spectators observed the body lying
on the ground, with the head still enveloped in the white cap,

barrister-at-law (L.).&nbsp; The polling took place on the 25th,
between the hours of eight a.m. and eight p.m.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Market Place was the scene of a regular carnival.&nbsp; The
principal form of practical joking was the discharge of small
bags of flour at any prominent person who chanced to run the
gauntlet of the crowd.&nbsp; No ill-temper was displayed, and
probably no election ever took place in Norwich where so little
animosity was exhibited.&nbsp; We think the keeping of the poll
open until eight o&rsquo;clock was generally admitted to be a
mistake, as unnecessarily prolonging the excitement incidental to
an election where party feeling runs high.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
close of the poll the ballot boxes were conveyed to the
Guildhall, where the counting immediately commenced, and the
result was declared at 12.45 as follows:&mdash;Bullard, 7,279;

20th, Mr. Justice Hawkins, after delivering his charge to the
Grand Jury at the Norfolk Assizes, said he could not offer the
magistrates his gratitude for their endeavours to provide for the
comfort of her Majesty&rsquo;s judges, unless, indeed, they
thought he and his marshal had the habits and tastes of a Polar
bear and an Arctic fox.&nbsp; Eaton Hall was well fitted for one
or both, as it was simply a bleak house in a frozen waste; it was
redolent of putty and paint; workmen were tapping just beyond the
dining-room door in precisely the same way as he should expect to
hear tapping in the back manufactory of an undertaker&rsquo;s
shop; and the rooms were furnished with the view to economy and
discomfort with a show of luxury skilfully but not very
judiciously combined.&nbsp; On November 15th Mr. Justice Field,
in concluding his charge to the Grand Jury, said he found the
accommodation at Eaton Hall exceedingly nice and extremely
comfortable, and he added, amid laughter, he had not seen any
Polar bears or Arctic foxes.</p>

Dutch Church from the trustees to the Board, with the view of
converting the building into a higher grade school.&nbsp; The
Norfolk and Norwich Arch&aelig;ological Society addressed to the

Buildings, at which it was moved by Mr. Colman, M.P., seconded by

inalienable use of the building as an adjunct to and in
connection with St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, subject to existing
rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was further decided to raise by public

<p>18.&mdash;Died, at Marham Hall, Mr. Henry Villebois, aged
79.&nbsp; An excellent landlord, an ardent sportsman, and for
some years Master of the <a name="page367"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 367</span>West Norfolk Foxhounds, Mr.
Villebois was one of the earliest friends in Norfolk of the
Prince of Wales, whom he had the honour of several times
entertaining at Marham.&nbsp; He married, in 1831, Maria, elder
daughter of Mr. Thomas Philip Bagge, of Stradsett Hall, and was a
magistrate and a Deputy Lieutenant for the county.&nbsp; Mr.
Villebois commenced active duties as a M.F.H. about 1842, when he
took the Vale of White Horse, purchasing the pack from the
triumvirate, the Earl of Suffolk, Earl Bathurst, and Mr. Cripps,
who had hunted the country conjointly.&nbsp; He likewise
purchased the Herefordshire Hounds from Sir Vevers Cornwall, and,
with John Dinnecombe as huntsman, showed excellent sport until
1854, when, in consequence of a severe accident, he resigned the
mastership to Lord Gifford, and sold his hounds to the Earl of
Portsmouth.&nbsp; For the next three or four years he hunted with
Lord Suffield, and in 1858 consented to hunt the West
Norfolk.&nbsp; His lordship continued with the East Norfolk, but
resigned in 1859; Mr. Villebois then hunted the entire country,
but after two or three years resigned the Eastern portion to Lord
Hastings.&nbsp; In the spring of 1865 Mr. Villebois sold his
hounds and horses at Albert Gate, when seven of the hunters,
bought from Mr. Newcome Mason, of Hendon, his great ally in all
hunting matters, realised 1,015 guineas.&nbsp; After giving up
the mastership he stuck to West Norfolk, and from 1871 to 1875
hunted the country round Marham with a small pack purchased from
the Rev. &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Russell.&nbsp; The shooting at Marham

<p>&mdash;A great meeting of &ldquo;an entirely non-party
character&rdquo; was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich,
under the presidency of the Earl of Leicester, Lord Lieutenant of
the county, in support of the principles of the Irish Loyal and
Patriotic Union.&nbsp; A resolution was adopted affirming that
any proposals tending to invalidate the legislative union between
Great Britain and Ireland would prove disastrous to the interests
of both countries.&nbsp; On June 25th Lord Leicester wrote a
letter which had an important influence upon the electorate of
the county.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never been in the habit,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;of taking part in political matters of a purely
party description, though if ever I should have been inclined to
break through the rule it would be at a time like the present,
when we are passing through a great crisis in our national
history, when the old party barriers have been broken down, and
when Liberals, Radicals, and Conservatives meet on a common
platform in a common cause.&nbsp; The question before the country
is solely this: whether the loyalists and Protestants of Ireland
should be legislated for by an independent Parliament composed of
men whom Mr. Gladstone himself has termed as marching through
rapine to the dismemberment of the empire, or whether the United
Kingdom is to remain under one Queen and one Parliament.&nbsp; I
cannot believe that Englishmen will ever consent to the former
proposal.&nbsp; I trust that the electors of Norfolk, with those
of the rest of England, will insist that their members shall be
patriots and decline to support Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s dangerous
policy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Suffield and other prominent Liberals
also renounced their adhesion to Mr. Gladstone.</p>

Hall to one month&rsquo;s, and Hurrell to one week&rsquo;s
imprisonment, with hard labour.&nbsp; A similar disturbance on a

from the office of Mayor of the city he sought relaxation on the
shores of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; A severe shock of earthquake,

have told upon his highly sensitive and nervous organization, and
to have indirectly caused his death.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney was the
eldest son of Mr. John Gurney, of Earlham Hall, and grandson of
Mr. Samuel Gurney, of West Ham.&nbsp; He was born on December

right of the freemen to receive in perpetuity the rents of the
Town Close Estate, a valuable plot of land of about 100 acres in
extent, which was conveyed to the city in 1524 by the Prior of
Norwich.&nbsp; It was contended on the part of the plaintiffs
that this land became vested in the Corporation for the exclusive
benefit of the freemen, the terms in the original grant
&ldquo;citizens&rdquo; and &ldquo;commonalty&rdquo; being
synonymous with &ldquo;freemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Justice Kekewich
concurred in this contention, gave judgment for the plaintiffs,
and ordered the costs of the action to be borne by the
estate.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 23rd, 1888.)</p>
<p><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>23.&mdash;A remarkable sale by auction was held at
Leziate under a warrant of distress for the non-payment of
tithe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. W. H. Boyce, of Holt House Farm, having
made up his mind to object on principle to the payment of the
tithe rent charged by the Rev. A. J. Groom, rector of
Ashwicken-cum-Leziate, and having also failed to induce the
rector or his legal agent to make any abatement of the amount
due, namely, &pound;42 8s., a warrant of distress was issued,
under which seizure was made of ten homebred steers, two cows in
calf, and part of a stack of hay.&nbsp; The sale was conducted by
Mr. W. B. Lane.&nbsp; It was carried out in quite an amicable
manner, and the humour of the thing was enhanced by Mr. Boyce
providing luncheon for those in attendance.&nbsp; The auctioneer
had sold up to a certain point, when he announced that his duty
was done, but Mr. Boyce gave him a commission to go on selling as
long as he liked.&nbsp; This he accordingly did with excellent
results.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the action Mr. Boyce thanked
his friends for the way in which they had acted, expressed his
objections to tithes in general, and the present claim in
particular, and afterwards entertained several of his friends at
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;In the Queen&rsquo;s Bench Division of the High Court
of Justice, before Mr. Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Stephen, a
petition was presented by Mr. Joseph Arch against the return of
Lord Henry Bentinck as member for North-West Norfolk, on July
9th, 1886.&nbsp; The petitioner alleged that the respondent was
guilty of an illegal practice in paying the sum of &pound;3 to
Charles Wacey, of South Creake, in respect of expenses in the
conduct or management of the election.&nbsp; The money was sent
in a letter from Guist Hall, where Lord Henry Bentinck was
staying, on January 20th.&nbsp; The letter was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Mr. Wacey&mdash;I enclose you a little
present as some small compensation for the trouble and worry you
have had in connection with the election and afterward.&nbsp; I
am much obliged to you for all you have done, and I hope you will
continue to help us in the future in the same able and energetic
manner in which you have done in the past.&nbsp; Yours truly,
Henry Bentinck.&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; You had better not tell anyone
that I sent you anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; This letter miscarried,
and was delivered not to Charles Wacey, but to Thomas Wacey, who
belonged to the party represented by Mr. Arch.&nbsp; Thomas Wacey
ultimately forwarded the postal orders contained in the letter to
Charles Wacey, who cashed them and kept the proceeds.&nbsp; It
was contended on the part of the respondent that the payment made
in January, 1887, had no relation whatever to the conduct or
management of the election in July, 1886.&nbsp; The money was
paid on account of registration services, and the injunction of
secrecy was made because to have paid all the district
secretaries would have involved the respondent in an expenditure
of &pound;100.&nbsp; The petition was dismissed with costs.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;The currency question was discussed by the Norfolk
Chamber of Agriculture, and a resolution adopted expressing alarm
at the daily increasing difficulty experienced by the
agricultural classes in obtaining money with which to meet their
obligations, asserting the belief that &ldquo;an increase in the
circulating medium would lessen that difficulty,&rdquo; and
urging the Government &ldquo;to respond to the invitation of the
great Powers who had asked this country to join with them in
restoring to the peoples the free coinage and use of silver
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following resolution was also
adopted:&mdash;&ldquo;Although currency may in some way affect
the prosperity of trade and agriculture in this country, it is
the opinion of this Chamber that the main cause of the depression
is the influx of foreign produce to the ruin of the English
producer and the employment of foreign labour in the place of
English labour.&rdquo;</p>

constant adviser of Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett throughout his
chequered experiences on the hustings and in the election

that Chapel Field was transformed from a barren and useless waste
into a beautiful garden.</p>

Cambridge, where he took the degree of B.A., and proceeded M.A.
in due course.&nbsp; Abandoning the idea of adopting the clerical
profession, Mr. Simpson travelled on the Continent and in the
East.&nbsp; He was in Paris when a sudden and severe reverse of
fortune, consequent upon the failure of a bank, compelled him to
seek means of repairing his losses.&nbsp; Literary occupation
seemed the only course open to him, <a name="page383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>and, as he confessed, he succeeded
in his efforts beyond expectation.&nbsp; For some years he
contributed to the leading

Tales,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gisella,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lily of
Paris, or the King&rsquo;s Nurse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Simpson&rsquo;s career as a writer for the stage was mainly due
to accident.&nbsp; He seldom visited theatres, but it chanced one
night that he went to the Strand Theatre, and was so pleased with
the performance of William Farren, Leigh Murray, and Mrs.
Stilling that he conceived the idea of writing a play for them,
and the result was the comedy drama in one act, entitled
&ldquo;Poor Cousin Dick,&rdquo; which was played with
considerable success at the house on April 8th, 1850.&nbsp;
Subsequently Mr. Simpson wrote several successful plays, the
principal of which was the famous three-act comedy, &ldquo;A
Scrap of Paper,&rdquo; produced at St. James&rsquo;s Theatre on
April 23rd, 1861.</p>

<p>23.&mdash;The action, Stanley <i>v.</i> the Mayor and
Corporation of Norwich, arising out of the claim of the freemen
to the Town Close Estate, came before Mr. Justice Kekewich in the
Royal Court of Judicature.&nbsp; Mr. Walter Rye, Mr.
Stanley&rsquo;s agent, asked that it might be referred to Mr.
Blofeld, Recorder of Ipswich and Chancellor of the Diocese of
Norwich, to enquire and report who were the persons entitled as
freemen to participate in the rents and profits of the estate,
and what persons were entitled to be admitted as freemen under
the inquiry directed by the judgment given in March, 1887.&nbsp;
His lordship made the order asked for, and directed that the
inquiry be held at the Guildhall, Norwich, or at such other place
as the referee might from time to time direct.&nbsp; Mr. Blofeld
opened the inquiry on March 19th, and continued the proceedings
on the 20th, when a large number of freemen attended for the
purpose of proving their right to have their names placed upon
the roll.&nbsp; On the same day (the 20th) it was reported to the
Town Council that the cost of the Town Close Estate litigation
amounted to &pound;4,500, and a resolution was adopted for leave
to borrow the amount on mortgage of the estate.&nbsp; In the
Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, on July 7th, a
point was raised as to the jurisdiction of the court to affirm a
declaration of the Attorney-General creating the Town Close
Estate a charity.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Kekewich, on July 14th,
sustained the objection taken by the respondents to the
Attorney-General&rsquo;s application, and held that before
issuing a summons the Attorney-General must establish by
independent proceedings an information that there was a charity
in existence to be regulated.&nbsp; The summons had been so drawn
as to assume the existence of a charity, and this was just what
his lordship thought could not be assumed.&nbsp; On December
14th, in the Supreme Court, before Lords Justices Cotton,
Lindley, and Bowen, the Attorney-General appealed from Mr.
Justice Kekewich&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp; Their lordships, after
hearing arguments, held that Mr. Justice Kekewich had determined
by his judgment that the Town Close Estate was a charitable
trust.&nbsp; On December 20th, however, their lordships
reconsidered their decision, directed the order of Mr. Justice
Kekewich to be discharged, and ordered the summons to be set down
for further argument, and to decide whether there was or was not
a charity.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 21st, 1889.)</p>

Council gives its cordial support to a proposal of the Charity
Commissioners to utilise the funds of the Norwich Charities for
the purposes of technical education.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel Bignold
moved, &ldquo;That no application of the funds of Anguish&rsquo;s
and the allied charities can be satisfactory to this Council
which is not strictly in accordance with the will of Thomas
Anguish confirmed and settled by Royal Charter in 1629, namely,
for the sustentation, relief, and maintenance, as well as the
teaching, of all very poor children born and brought up in the
city of Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; This resolution was adopted at an
adjourned meeting on the 7th, and a committee appointed &ldquo;to
consider the present position of the trust, and, if necessary, to
confer with the Charity Trustees, and still further, if
necessary, to communicate with the Commissioners.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the 28th the Special Committee submitted the following
suggestions to the Council for approval:&mdash;&ldquo;(1) That in
any scheme which may be submitted by the Charity Trustees to the
Commissioners a sum not exceeding &pound;200 per annum be set
aside for the purposes of technical education out of the
Boys&rsquo; Hospital.&nbsp; (2) That the residue of the fund be
devoted to the sustentation, relief, maintenance, and elementary
education of as many boys as the money will provide for.&nbsp;
(3.) That if considered within the meaning of the trust this
committee would be willing to accept a scheme of maintenance
other than that provided for by the Home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile
the Trustees submitted amended proposals, but on March 20th the
Council adopted those drawn up by the Special Committee.&nbsp;

<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Died, at Ormesby Lodge, Sir Edmund Henry Knowles
Lacon, Bart.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Knowles

James Esdale Hammet, of Battersea.&nbsp; He succeeded to the
baronetcy in 1839.&nbsp; Sir Edmund was first returned to
Parliament for the borough of Yarmouth in 1852.&nbsp; At the next
General Election, in March, 1857, Mr. McCallagh and Mr. E. A.
Watkin gained the representation of the constituency by a narrow
majority over Sir Edmund and his colleague, the Hon. Charles
Smyth Vereker, son of Viscount Gort.&nbsp; A petition was
presented, and a Committee of the House of Commons declared the
election void.&nbsp; Thereupon Sir Edmund issued an address, but
subsequently followed the example of Mr. Vereker, and retired, so
<a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>that
Serjeant (afterwards Mr. Justice) Mellor and Mr. Adolphus W.
Young had a walk-over.&nbsp; On the dissolution taking place in
1859 he and Sir Henry Stracey defeated Messrs. Watkin and Young;
a petition and enquiry followed, but they were declared duly
elected.&nbsp; In 1865 Sir Henry Stracey retired, leaving Sir
Edmund with Mr. James Goodson as his colleague, and both were
returned in opposition to Mr. Alexander Brogden and Mr. Philip
Vanderbyl, who presented a petition, which, though the sitting
members were undisturbed, resulted in the Committee reporting
that they had reason to believe corrupt practices had
prevailed.&nbsp; A Royal Commission and the disfranchisement of
the borough followed.&nbsp; Then came the Reform and
Redistribution Acts of 1868, under which the county of Norfolk
was divided into three parts, and Yarmouth was merged in the
Northern Division.&nbsp; At the first election under the new
arrangement Sir Edmund Lacon and his colleague, the Hon.
Frederick Walpole, were returned, notwithstanding the powerful
opposition of the Liberal party, who had brought forward Mr.
Edmond R. Wodehouse and Mr. R. T. Gurdon.&nbsp; A petition was
presented, and failed.&nbsp; In 1869 Sir Edmund was presented by
his constituents with a piece of silver plate weighing 900 ozs.,
and valued at upwards of &pound;600, in recognition of his
services to the Conservative cause.&nbsp; In 1874 he and Mr.
Walpole were returned unopposed, and in 1880 there was again no
contest, when Sir Edmund and Mr. (afterwards Sir Edward) Birkbeck
were elected on the death of Colonel Duff, who had succeeded Mr.
Walpole.&nbsp; Under the redistribution scheme of 1885 Yarmouth
was allowed one member, but at the next General Election Sir
Edmund retired, and Sir H. W. Tyler was elected in his
stead.&nbsp; Sir Edmund Lacon was senior partner in the banking
firm of Lacons, Youells, and Co., and in the extensive brewery of
Lacons and Co.&nbsp; On the death of Lord Sondes in 1875 he was

for Norfolk and a magistrate for Norfolk and Suffolk.&nbsp; Sir

years been engaged on the Ordnance Survey, left Norwich for
York.&nbsp; The work in Norfolk was completed in 1883, and it was
found that very little alteration was needed in the map drawn
thirty or forty years previously.&nbsp; The survey of the
northern half of Cambridgeshire was then commenced and was
completed in 1885; this was followed by the survey of a portion
of Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire, including the city of
Peterborough; and finally the southern half of Lincolnshire,
which was finished in April, 1887.&nbsp; The detachment,
including women and children, numbered 120, and the official
papers, books, &amp;c., weighed between 30 and 40 tons.&nbsp; The
first commanding officer was Captain Macpherson, who was
succeeded by Captain Day and by Major Washington.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The new Hospital, erected at Dene Side, Yarmouth,
was publicly opened by Sir James Paget, the distinguished
physician, a native of the town.&nbsp; The total cost of the

<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died, Sir Lewis Whincop Jarvis, in his 72nd
year.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. Lewis Weston Jarvis, and a
grandson of Mr. Robert T. Whincop, a former Town Clerk of
Lynn.&nbsp; For more than fifty years he carried on business as a
banker and solicitor in his native town of Lynn, and on January
15th, 1878, received the honour of knighthood in recognition of
the many eminent services he had rendered to the borough.&nbsp;
He married, in 1850, Emma, daughter of Mr. Alexander Bowker, by
whom he left issue five sons and a daughter.&nbsp; Sir Lewis was

<p>26.&mdash;At Blofield Petty Sessions, Jeremiah Cozens Wiley,
farmer, of Little Plumstead; Samuel Rose, farm steward; William
Feek and Thomas Powley, labourers, of the same place, were
summoned on the information of John Ford, an inspector of the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for
&ldquo;unlawfully ill-treating and torturing 16 bullocks by
dishorning them on October 8th and 15th.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Colam,
barrister-at-law, prosecuted on behalf of the society, and Mr. H.
J. Gidney, of Aylsham, defended.&nbsp; The case excited great
interest, and the court was crowded by a large number of
scientific witnesses and leading agriculturists.&nbsp; The act of
dishorning the animals was admitted by the defendants, and in
support of the contention of the prosecution that the operation
was unnecessary and cruel were called Professor Walley, principal
of the Edinburgh Veterinary College; Professor McCall, principal
of the Glasgow Veterinary College; Professor F. Collins,
F.R.C.V.S., Mr. G. A. Lepper, F.R.C.V.S, Professor Pritchard,
President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London;
Mr. Cox, F.R.C.V.S., Professor J. McQueen, and several local
veterinary surgeons.&nbsp; It was urged in defence that the
operation, although painful, was necessary and humane, because it
prevented cattle injuring each other with their horns.&nbsp;
Several prominent agriculturists and graziers, including Mr.
Clare Sewell Read, Mr. B. B. Sapwell, and Mr. William Case, gave
evidence <a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>in support of this view.&nbsp; The magistrates
dismissed the informations, and the chairman (Mr. Edward Gilbert)
said &ldquo;they considered the operation a most painful one, but
they did not suppose that Mr. Wiley did it with any cruel
intention towards the animals on which the operation was
performed.&nbsp; If it went forth to the public that it was
advisable to have polled cattle it would be seen also that it was
advisable that the animals should be operated upon at an earlier
stage.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 16th, 1889.)</p>
<p>29.&mdash;Mr. J. L. Toole commenced a three nights&rsquo;

<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The weather was very mild at this date.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That 1888 will be noted as an extraordinary year in the

cattle, <i>i.e.</i>, sawing off their horns at the roots, was
cruelty within the meaning of the Act for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.&nbsp; The Blofield Bench of magistrates had
ruled in the negative.&nbsp; Lord Coleridge said: &ldquo;All that
we have to say for the present is that we have made up our minds
distinctly and clearly to give judgment reversing the decision of
the magistrates, holding as we do that the practice of dishorning
is unlawful.&nbsp; But as we differ from several judgments we
think it only respectful to the learned judges who decided those
cases to say that we have duly considered everything they have
said on the subject, and therefore we have thought right to take
time to put our judgment into writing (though we entirely agree
in it), and we will deliver judgment early in the next
sitting.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May 18th the Lord Chief Justice, in
delivering judgment, said the operation of dishorning was
detestably brutal, and it was also unnecessary except to enable
its owner to obtain a pound or two more for the animal on its
sale.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Hawkins concurred, and the case was
remitted to the magistrates for further hearing.</p>

few years ago the announcement of Mr. Gunn&rsquo;s retirement

concerning certain Biblical statements which he conceived to be

rectory of Baconsthorpe, and in 1881 to the living which he held
at the time of his death.&nbsp; Mr. Feilden was a Commissioner
under the Pluralities Act, for the Archdeaconry of Norfolk, and
for nine years was a member of the Board of Management of the

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A meeting, convened by the Lord Lieutenant of the
county (the Earl of Leicester) and the High Sheriff (Mr. S.
Gurney Buxton), was held at the Shirehall, Norwich, to consider
what steps should be taken to provide a present from Norfolk to
the Duke of Clarence and Avondale and Princess Mary Victoria on
the occasion of their marriage.&nbsp; It was resolved to open a
public subscription.&nbsp; A similar movement was inaugurated by
the citizens of Norwich.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norfolk County Council appointed Mr. H. C.
Bolingbroke &ldquo;accountant officer&rdquo; to fill the vacancy
occasioned by the retirement of Mr. H. W. Day from the office of
County Treasurer.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Died, at Sandringham, his Royal Highness the Duke of
Clarence and Avondale.&nbsp; The intelligence of the death of the
young Prince was received in Norwich with many manifestations of
public sorrow and sympathy.&nbsp; The church bells were tolled,
flags were hoisted at half-mast upon all public buildings, and
the windows of business establishments and private residences
were shaded.&nbsp; The High Sheriff at once sent to the
Comptroller of the Household of the Prince and Princess of Wales
a telegram of sympathy on behalf of himself and the whole county
of Norfolk, and on the 15th a special meeting of the Norwich Town
Council was held, and addresses of condolence were ordered to be
sent to the Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Princess
Victoria Mary of Teck.&nbsp; On Sunday, the 17th, many touching
references to the sad event were made in Church and Nonconformist
places of worship; and on the 20th, on which day the remains of
the deceased Prince were removed from Sandringham to Windsor for
interment, a memorial service, attended by the Mayor and
Corporation, was held at Norwich Cathedral, and the Dean preached

Baptist chapel similar services were held, business was suspended
in the city, and the licensed victuallers and hotel proprietors
closed their establishments from two o&rsquo;clock until five

observed with profound solemnity.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;An important meeting was held at the Deanery,
Norwich, to discuss what measures should be taken to complete the
sum of &pound;2,500 then being raised by the Church
Schools&rsquo; Aid Association for the special purpose of
increasing and improving the accommodation of the Church day
schools in the city.&nbsp; It was resolved that it was the
imperative duty of Churchmen to preserve the Church schools in a
state of efficiency, and with this object it was decided that the
clergy and laity form local branches to augment the fund.</p>
<p><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
426</span>19.&mdash;Another series of &ldquo;Science Lectures for

came the Great Ice Age?&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 12th,

<p>23.&mdash;Influenza raged with great severity in city and
county, and many prominent people were attacked by the
complaint.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is producing many deaths among the
aged; the mortality in Norwich last week was 40.1 per
thousand.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the week ending January 30th the
mortality in the city had increased to 44 per thousand.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died, at the Shrubbery, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Road,
Norwich, Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett.&nbsp; He was born November 1st,
1818, at Quay Side, St. Martin-at-Palace, Norwich, and was son of
Mr. Jacob Tillett, a dyer.&nbsp; His grandfather was a
schoolmaster, whose attainments in mathematics, navigation, and
gunnery brought him into some prominence in his day.&nbsp; Young
Tillett was educated at King Edward VI. Grammar School, and on
leaving school served his articles with Mr. John Rising Staff,
then a leading solicitor in Norwich.&nbsp; In 1839 he opened an
office for himself in Post Office Street, and obtained a large
and lucrative connection.&nbsp; Literary rather than legal work
best accorded with Mr. Tillett&rsquo;s natural tastes.&nbsp; In
1845 he founded the &ldquo;Norfolk News,&rdquo; and with the
conduct of that journal he was thenceforward associated
throughout his life, as chairman of the company and as editor, in
which position he not only controlled the policy of the paper,
but weekly contributed its leading articles.&nbsp; For many years
Mr. Tillett was a member of the Town Council, and twice served
the office of Mayor, first in 1859&ndash;60 and again in
1875&ndash;76.&nbsp; He was twice returned to a seat on the
Norwich School Board, and on the second occasion was elected
Chairman.&nbsp; In 1874 he was appointed a justice of the peace,
but he never qualified.&nbsp; Although he was not attached to any
particular sect, he identified himself with various religious
movements in the city.&nbsp; Mr. Tillett was the most potent
political personal force that the century produced in
Norwich.&nbsp; He contested the city in 1868 unsuccessfully, Sir
Henry Stracey and Sir Wm. Russell being returned.&nbsp; That
election was invalidated on petition.&nbsp; In May, 1870, when a
new writ was issued for the vacant seat, Mr. Tillett was returned
by 4,236 votes against 3,874 polled by Mr. J. W.
Huddleston.&nbsp; A petition followed, and Mr. Tillett was
unseated.&nbsp; At the dissolution in 1874 the Conservatives
brought forward Sir Henry Stracey and Mr. Huddleston, and the
Liberal cause was again championed by Mr. Tillett, with Mr.
Colman as his colleague.&nbsp; Mr. Colman was returned at the
head of the poll with 6,138 votes, and Mr. Huddleston was the
other successful candidate, with 5,823 votes.&nbsp; Mr. Tillett
polled 5,776 and Sir Henry Stracey 5,290 votes.&nbsp; Early in
1875 Mr. Huddleston was raised to the judicial bench, and at the
bye-election Mr. Tillett entered the lists against Colonel
Wilkinson.&nbsp; The contest took place on March 5th, and
resulted in Mr. Tillett&rsquo;s return by a majority of
799.&nbsp; Then came the third petition, on which Mr. Tillett was
again unseated, and a Royal Commission followed.&nbsp; The writ
was suspended until the dissolution in 1880, when the
Conservatives were represented by Mr. H. Harben and the Hon.
Massey Mainwaring.&nbsp; The seats were <a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>carried by
Mr. Colman and Mr. Tillett on a poll of 6,549 for the former and
6,512 for the latter, the votes for the Conservative candidates
being 5,242 for Mr. Harben and 5,032 for Mr. Mainwaring.&nbsp;
The successful candidates were allowed to retain their seats
undisturbed; but Mr. Tillett reached the goal of his ambition too
late to derive any satisfaction from it, and the five years he
spent in Parliament were among the most irksome and worrying of
any in his life.&nbsp; At the dissolution in 1885 he announced
his intention not to again offer himself for the representation
of the city; but in 1886 he was once more induced to stand, and,
with Mr. Colman, opposed the return of Mr. Samuel Hoare and Mr.
C. S. Read.&nbsp; The result of the poll was as
follows:&mdash;Colman, 6,295; Hoare, 6,156; Tillett, 6,119; Read,
5,564.&nbsp; With this campaign Mr. Tillett practically closed
his electioneering career.&nbsp; Whatever the Conservative party
may have thought of his political faults and shortcomings, Mr.
Tillett was no Socialist or Revolutionist.&nbsp; He was staunch
in his loyalty to the Throne, and would have strongly opposed any
attack upon the free monarchial constitution.&nbsp; Although he
stood at the 1886 election as a Gladstonian, his convictions were
in favour of the maintenance of the Union.&nbsp; For the private
character of this eminent citizen it was impossible to entertain
but one sentiment, that of the highest esteem and regard, for he
was naturally of a kind, considerate, and affectionate
disposition.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;Official notice was received at Norwich of the final
settlement of the scheme proposed by the Attorney-General for the
administration of the Norwich Town Close Estate Charity.&nbsp;
The scheme provided that the charity and its property and
endowments should be vested in an official trustee of charity
lands for the city of Norwich, and the management, preservation,
and letting of the estate and the collecting of the income by a
receiver would be exercised by trustees consisting of the
trustees for the time being of the municipal charities of the

the eldest son of Mr. William Norton, of Old Buckenham, and in
his early days was articled to Messrs. Mitchell and Clarke, a
well-known firm of solicitors at Wymondham.&nbsp; Much of his
time was subsequently spent in roaming over the greater part of
Europe, and in about 1860 he settled in Norwich.&nbsp; As a
scholar and a man of science Mr. Norton was possessed of a store
of information such as few had acquired.&nbsp; Sanskrit and
geology were his favourite studies.&nbsp; He was an omnivorous
reader and lover of books, and bequeathed his valuable library
and collection of manuscripts to the Norfolk and Norwich
Library.</p>
<p><a name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

aged 88.&nbsp; He was born at Red Hall, Leeds, and was educated
at St. Catherine&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, of which he became
Fellow and tutor.&nbsp; In his Cambridge days he published some
mathematical treatises, which added considerably to his
reputation as a college tutor.&nbsp; On withdrawing from the
University he became rector of Gimingham in 1833, and an active
worker on behalf of many diocesan organizations.&nbsp; He paid
special regard to the social improvement of the labourers, and
was known as &ldquo;the father of the allotment
system.&rdquo;&nbsp; For many years Mr. Blakelock was Archdeacon
of Norfolk.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died, at Rippon Hall, Hevingham, the Rev. Henry
Philip Marsham, aged 75.&nbsp; He was a son of Mr. Robert
Marsham, of Stratton Hall, and his taste for country life and
love of nature had descended to him from his great grandfather,
Robert Marsham, the ardent naturalist and frequent correspondent
with White, of Selborne.&nbsp; The annual records of the earliest
dates, when many common plants were observed to flower, together
with similar natural history data, as commenced by the elder
naturalist, were continued by the younger.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The memorial stones of a permanent building, to be
used as the headquarters of the Salvation Army in Norwich, were
laid by Mr. George White and other prominent Nonconformists, on a
site at the rear of Mortimer&rsquo;s Hotel, St. Giles&rsquo;
Street.&nbsp; The building, which, inclusive of the site, cost
about &pound;4,000, was opened on October 30th.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;A scheme for altering the number and bounderies of
the wards in Norwich was unanimously adopted by the Town
Council.&nbsp; The Privy Council on June 16th were petitioned to
approve the scheme, and on July 8th the formal order was received
for dividing the city into sixteen wards.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Neve
Creswell, the Commissioner appointed to prepare the scheme for
determining the boundaries of the wards and for apportioning
councillors among them, held a public inquiry at the Guildhall on
July 28th, at which evidence was given by representatives of the
Town Council and others.&nbsp; The first municipal elections
under the provisions of the redistribution scheme took place on

instead of for eight.</p>

<p>21.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Mathew
and a special jury, was tried the action, Bullard and others
<i>v.</i> Saul.&nbsp; The case was brought by the plaintiffs as
trustees of the charities of St. Swithin, Norwich, for an alleged
slander uttered by the defendant at an inquiry held before an
assistant Charity Commissioner at Norwich on January 15th.&nbsp;
By the words that the defendant used on that occasion the
plaintiffs said they understood him to mean that they had been
guilty of maladministration <a name="page429"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 429</span>of the charity funds, and had
administered them for base and political purposes, and as
vehicles of all sorts of corruption.&nbsp; The defendant denied
that the words set out in the statement of claim were a correct
report of the words used by him at the inquiry, and he further
denied that they had any slanderous meaning.&nbsp; A verdict was
given for the plaintiffs&mdash;damages &pound;5.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;In the Court of Arches Lord Penzance decided in

Mr. O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s appeal until he had given security for
the Bishop&rsquo;s costs, and limited the time during which the
appellant should find such security to four months.&nbsp;

Street, and afterwards transferred to Chapel Field.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died, at Unthank&rsquo;s Road, Norwich, the Rev.
Charles Heath Hosken, Baptist minister, in his 81st year.&nbsp;
In his early days he was sent to Ireland for missionary work by
the Baptist Irish Missionary Society, and subsequently laboured
at Belize in the Bay of Honduras; at West Troy in the State of
New York, and at Crayford in Kent.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Rev. C. H.
Spurgeon sent his first two students to Mr. Hosken to be trained;
thus the deceased was really associated with the foundation of
the Pastors&rsquo; College.&rdquo;</p>

wedding at Hellesdon House, Norwich, and were the recipients of
many presents from friends in county and city, and from the staff

<p>30.&mdash;Died, at Sheringham Hall, Mr. Henry Ramey Upcher,
aged 82.&nbsp; He was a son of the Rev. Abbot Upcher, and coming
to the estate when only nine years old, he had probably been in
possession of his property longer than any landowner in
England.&nbsp; When at Harrow he played in the cricket eleven,
and on leaving Cambridge University took a leading part in
athletic games, and was well-known throughout the country as a
clever cricketer, a good horseman, and an excellent shot.&nbsp;
Mr. Upcher married, on July 3rd, 1838, Miss Caroline
Morris.&nbsp; In politics he was a Liberal of the old school, and
a valued supporter of his party.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;Mr. Justice Romer delivered judgment in the action,
Micklethwaite <i>v.</i> Vincent, which raised an important
question as to the rights of the public over the Norfolk
broads.&nbsp; The plaintiff asked for an injunction to restrain
the defendant from shooting or fishing on that part of the
Hickling Broad which was in the parish of Hickling, and from
boating over it except in a certain channel.&nbsp; The defendant
contended that the Broad was open to the public for all purposes,
and that he as one of the public was entitled to shoot and fish
over it.&nbsp; The judge held that the plaintiff had established
his right to the part of the Broad in question.&nbsp; Admittedly
there was a public way over the Broad, but this was restricted to
the channel.&nbsp; The plaintiff asked for an injunction to
restrain the defendant from going on the Broad at all except in
this channel.&nbsp; He was satisfied on the evidence that this
right of way was not so restricted, and that part of
plaintiff&rsquo;s claim failed and must be dismissed.&nbsp; It
was not necessary for his lordship to decide how far the
plaintiff&rsquo;s right extended beyond the channel.&nbsp; The
plaintiff must get from the defendant the bare costs of the
action, except so far as those costs had been increased by the
claim to restrict the right of way to the channel, which had
failed.&nbsp; So far as the defendant&rsquo;s costs had been
increased by the last mentioned claim he would get them from the
plaintiff with the set-off.</p>

<p>22.&mdash;In the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,
before Mr. Justice North, the action, Boswell <i>v.</i> Coaks,
came on for hearing.&nbsp; It was brought for the purpose of
re-opening the question which, after protracted litigation, had
been settled in the House of Lords.&nbsp; The present action was
founded on allegations of fraud on the part of one of the
successful litigants in the conduct of the litigation.&nbsp; The
judge did not call for a reply.&nbsp; He said he had come to the
conclusion that each allegation of fraud afforded no probable
cause for thinking that the plaintiff could possibly succeed at
the trial.&nbsp; After this matter had been thrashed out at such
an enormous expenditure of time and money he thought there would
be a grievous miscarriage of justice if he did not, so far as he
could, put a closure to steps to open up a matter upon
suggestions so unfounded and baseless as he considered the
plaintiff&rsquo;s pleadings to make.&nbsp; He did not mean to

from Hugh Hastings, of Elsing, and consequently <a
name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 440</span>from
Malcolm, King of Scotland.&nbsp; On the death of Hugh Hastings in
the sixteenth century, the Barony of Hastings (1264) fell into
abeyance between the two daughters, Anne, the elder, and
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Mr. Browne descended from the latter.&nbsp; The
abeyance lasted till about 1840, when Lord John Russell advised
her Majesty to terminate it in favour of Sir Jacob Astley, who
descended from Hugh Hastings&rsquo; brother.&nbsp; It was thought
that Lord John&rsquo;s decision was not unconnected with
politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;Died, at Bradenham Hall, Mr. William Meybohm Rider

family, and for several generations his ancestors had been
Norfolk squires.&nbsp; He was lord of the manor of West
Bradenham, a Deputy Lieutenant, and one of the most active
magistrates in the county.&nbsp; For many years he acted as a
Chairman of Norfolk Quarter Sessions held by adjournment at
Swaffham, and afterwards at Lynn, and for a long period was a
member of the Committee of Visitors to Norwich Castle.&nbsp;
After the passing of the Local Government Act, by which the
business previously transacted at Quarter Sessions was

representatives of the old county gentry, retired from active
participation in public affairs.&nbsp; He was educated at Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, called to the Bar in 1842, and married, in 1844,

Tripos in 1855, and was elected Tyrwhitt Hebrew Scholar in

and Halle, he returned to Cambridge, where he was appointed
Hebrew lecturer at his college, and subsequently became the
Senior Fellow.&nbsp; He was an active and valued member of the
Old Testament Revision Committee, and was for many years an
examiner in the theological and Semitic languages triposes, and
succeeded the Hon. Ion Keith Falconer as Lord Almoner&rsquo;s
Professor of Arabic.&nbsp; Afterwards he was appointed University
lecturer in Oriental Languages.&nbsp; The closing work of his
life was connected with <a name="page441"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 441</span>a discovery of extreme importance
and value, which he made in company with his former pupil, Mr. F.
C. Burkett, of a manuscript found by Mrs. Lewis, of Cambridge, in
1892, in the Convent of St. Catharine on Mount Sinai.&nbsp; A
careful examination of photographs taken by her from this MS.,
which was a palimpsest, revealed the important fact that the
nearly obliterated Syriac characters bore a close resemblance to
the fragmentary text found by Cureton in 1842, and that the
newly-found text comprised nearly all the four Gospels.&nbsp;
This discovery led to an expedition in the present year (1893) to
Mount Sinai, where the intricate task of deciphering and
transcribing the MS. was undertaken by Professor Bensly, Mr.
Burkett, and Mr. Rendel Harris.&nbsp; The Professor was well
known as the discoverer and editor of &ldquo;The Missing Fragment
of the Fourth Book of Ezra.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also edited the
Harklean version of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and at the time
of his death was engaged in preparing other important works for
the press.</p>

seen more than sixty summers; my father lived to be seventy-four,
and he has told me many times he never saw hawthorn in flower by
the first of May.&nbsp; Nor have I ever seen it till this season
before the first of May.&rdquo;</p>

the satisfaction of the association that it cannot by reason of
its liabilities continue its business, and that it is desirable
that the same should be wound up voluntarily, and that the
company be wound up accordingly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The original
scheme, it was stated, was too large and ambitious, and the
association was weighted at the outset with a capital expenditure
and an annual working outlay beyond its strength and
capacity.&nbsp; On September 9th it was announced: &ldquo;After
struggling for some years under heavy mortgage and liabilities
the Norfolk County School Association has been compelled to wind
up.&nbsp; The property has passed into the hands of Lord

but was subsequently restored by the House of Lords, was not
binding on the appellant or the other unsatisfied creditors of
Sir Robert Harvey, or of the firm of Harvey&rsquo;s and
Hudson&rsquo;s, on the ground that it was obtained by the fraud
of the respondents, and to secure for the appellant and the
creditors certain consequential relief.&nbsp; Mr. Crackanthorpe,
Q.C., and Mr. Brabant were for the appellant; and the
Attorney-General (Sir John Rigby, Q.C.), Mr. H. H. Cozens-Hardy,
Q.C., M.P., and Mr. Lawrence for the respondent.&nbsp; Lord
Selborne delivered judgment, and said it was not necessary to
hear counsel for the respondent.&nbsp; The question was whether
anything material to disturb the judgment of the House had been
newly discovered by the appellant.&nbsp; That involved a double
proposition&mdash;that something new had been discovered, and
that that something new was material.&nbsp; There was a total
defect both of allegation and of evidence as to that which alone
could make it material.&nbsp; He had no hesitation in saying that
in his opinion it had been dealt with most properly by the Court
of Appeal, and that their lordships ought now to dismiss this
action with costs, which he accordingly now moved.&nbsp; Their
lordships concurred, and the appeal was dismissed with
costs.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> November 13th, 1895.)</p>

signs of breaking up.&nbsp; For twenty-eight successive nights,

brought by the plaintiff, the trustee in the bankruptcy of Harvey
and Hudson&rsquo;s Bank, against Mr. Coaks, and the
representatives of Mr. E. C. Bailey, deceased, and of Mr. Hill,
deceased.&nbsp; The plaintiff asked for an account of all monies
received, for an enquiry of all purchases, leases, and profits
which had been made or received by Mr. Coaks in connection with
the estate, and also that interest upon the sums found due should
be calculated as from the date of the receipt until time of
payment.&nbsp; The argument in support of the plaintiff&rsquo;s
case lasted until the 15th, when Mr. Warmington, Q.C., by whom he
was represented, said that an arrangement had been arrived at by
counsel on both sides.&nbsp; The plaintiff proposed to take an
order of a general character as between himself and Mr. Coaks of
all sums he had received in respect of the estate of Sir Robert
Harvey.&nbsp; Mr. Coaks also gave up all the purchases that he
had made either of the bankrupt&rsquo;s estate or the separate
estate, and there would be the usual enquiry with regard to them
in order to bring out those which were profitable and those which
were not, giving to the plaintiff the opportunity of taking those
which were profitable and to leave the others according to the
usual plan, and there would be an account of profits.&nbsp; There
would also be an enquiry as to balances in Mr. Coaks&rsquo; hands
in respect to which he would be charged with interest.&nbsp; The
costs were to be moderated, and so moderated as that no costs
were to be allowed which had been charged elsewhere.&nbsp;

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>19.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council ordered a petition to be
presented to Parliament against a scheme for the construction of
electric tramways in the city.&nbsp; This course was adopted not
in a hostile spirit, but with the object of making the best terms
possible for the citizens.&nbsp; On February 9th the Corporation
gave its consent to the Tramways Bill then before Parliament, and
on February 23rd a petition signed by nearly 23,500 inhabitants
of the city was presented to the Town Council, asking them to
support the projected electric tramways as distinct from the
proposed scheme of light railways.&nbsp; The Parliamentary and
By-laws Committee on April 13th reported that they had considered
side by side the merits and proposals of the New General Traction
Company, Limited, to construct electric tramways in the city and
Thorpe, and of the British Electric Traction Company, Limited, to
construct light railways in the city and district, and were of
opinion that the interests of the city would be best served by
making an arrangement with the former company.&nbsp; It was
understood that the company had given an undertaking to withdraw
their Bill from Parliament at any time upon the request of the
Corporation.&nbsp; On April 23rd the Council adopted the
following motion:&mdash;&ldquo;(a) To enable the New General
Traction Company, Limited, to carry their Bill through Parliament
if terms can be arranged with the company satisfactory to the
committee, for the construction of electric tramways in the city;
(b) to oppose the application of the British Electric Traction
Company, Limited, for an order by the Light Railway Commissioners
authorising the company to construct light railways in the city
and adjoining districts; (c) that the committee be authorised to
take such action and incur such costs as may in their opinion be
necessary to carry out the above resolutions.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May

Select Committee of the House <a name="page476"></a><span

<p>23.&mdash;A public meeting convened by the Lord-Lieutenant of
the county (the Earl of Leicester) and the Mayor (Mr. C. R.
Gilman) was held at the Guildhall, Norwich, to decide upon the
method of celebrating locally the Diamond Jubilee of her Majesty
the Queen.&nbsp; The Dean of Norwich moved &ldquo;That
subscriptions be invited in order to raise a sum of money, to be
called the Diamond Jubilee Fund, for the purpose of building a
new Jenny Lind Infirmary for Sick Children, it being the strong
feeling of the meeting that no memorial could be found more
typical of the tender sympathy and interest ever shown by her
Majesty in the sufferings and needs of her people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Viscount Coke seconded the resolution, and a committee was
appointed to raise the fund.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 15th,

before Waterloo.&nbsp; She had a vivid recollection of June 15th,
1815.&nbsp; With her younger sisters, she in the early dawn
watched from the windows of her parents&rsquo; house the troops
passing to the field.&nbsp; Later in the day the girls attended
school as usual, and soon became aware that the battle had
begun.&nbsp; The servant sent to fetch her from school lost
herself in the crowd, and the children made their way home alone,
groping by the walls and passing through the throng of troops
marching to the field and the thickening stream of prisoners and
wounded returning.&nbsp; On the 17th and 18th she was all day
helping her parents to hand water and wine to the wounded as they
passed the door.&nbsp; Mrs. Collyer had personal recollections of
Mendelssohn, whose wife was long her intimate acquaintance, and
of Spohr, whose playing she had often heard and admired.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The members at Norwich of the National Union of Boot
and Shoe Operatives resolved to go out on strike.&nbsp; On April
17th it was stated &ldquo;the desertions from the ranks of the
shoe strikers and their return to work have been steady and
persistent during the week, although many hundreds are still
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several charges of intimidation from time to
time occupied the attention of the magistrates.&nbsp; On July
20th the Mayor made an appeal to masters and men to endeavour to
formulate a plan for the settlement of their differences, but
without effect.&nbsp; The strike having lasted six months, a
meeting of the men was held at the Victoria Hall, at which it was
stated that &pound;10,000 had been expended in strike pay, and it
was resolved that the struggle be continued.&nbsp; After lasting
thirty-four weeks the strike came to an end on October 22nd, when
terms were signed by the representatives of the masters and of
the men.&nbsp; The last distribution of strike pay was made on
the 23rd, and the men returned to work on the 25th (St.

works on arch&aelig;ological and other subjects.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Highways and Byways of Norwich&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peeps at
the Past&rdquo; are regarded as standard works.&nbsp;
Relinquishing the study of antiquarian matters, which by his
skilful treatment interested a wide circle of readers, Mr.
Knights had taken up the work of interpreting Shakespeare in the
light of Scripture, a subject that appealed to a very limited
section.&nbsp; He published in 1893 a book entitled &ldquo;Hamlet
Interpreted,&rdquo; which failed to bring him a reputation such
as he achieved by his arch&aelig;ological works.&nbsp; Mr.

Arch&aelig;ological Society by many valuable contributions
relating to the history of Norwich, and in 1884 he published his
magnificent work on &ldquo;Monumental Brasses on the Continent of
Europe,&rdquo; a field of labour &ldquo;hitherto almost
untilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another scarcely less laborious task was
achieved by the publication by Mr. Creeny, in November, 1891, of

having separate courts of Quarter Sessions and Petty Sessions,
the salaries of the recorder and the clerk of the peace, and of
the clerk to the borough justices in Petty Sessions in such
borough, and certain other expenses connected with the Quarter
Sessions and Petty Sessions were transferred from the borough
fund to the county fund.&nbsp; Thetford was a borough containing

were paid out of the borough fund, and the clerk to the borough
justices was paid a salary out of the same fund.&nbsp; The
plaintiffs contended that by the Act of 1888 the liability for
the expenses was transferred to the defendants, and they claimed

Raglan Street, Dereham Road, was charged on eight summonses with

thereby implying that he was a registered medical
practitioner.&nbsp; The Bench decided that Mr. Matthews, in using
the word &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; did not wilfully and falsely
pretend to be registered as such, and, therefore, dismissed the
case; but they considered there had been an infringement of the
law in the use of the word &ldquo;surgeon,&rdquo; for which the
defendant was fined &pound;1, and 12s. costs.&nbsp; At the
Norwich County Court on the 24th Mr. Matthews was sued by the

the communion table, and moving from the church certain ornaments
which stood there, namely, a cross of brass, two candlesticks,

<p>18.&mdash;Died at the Clyffe, Corton, Mr. Jeremiah James
Colman, of Carrow House, Norwich, aged 68.&nbsp; Mr. Colman came
of an old family of Norfolk yeomen.&nbsp; One of his ancestors,
Jeremiah Colman, who was born in 1777, established a flour mill
at Bawburgh, and afterwards carried on business at Norwich,
whence he removed to Stoke Holy Cross, where was formed the
nucleus of the great commercial undertaking now existing at
Carrow.&nbsp; The subject of this notice was the son of James
Colman, and was born in 1830.&nbsp; In 1856 he married Caroline,
daughter of Mr. W. H. Cozens-Hardy, of Letheringsett.&nbsp; Mr.
Colman was interested in agricultural pursuits and the breeding
of stock, and his famous herd of red-polls, and equally
well-known flock of Southdowns were for years represented at all
the great shows.&nbsp; Art and literature obtained his attention,
and he collected an unrivalled library of local works at Carrow
Abbey.&nbsp; Mr. Colman embarked largely in commercial
enterprises connected with the Press.&nbsp; With Mr. Jacob Henry
Tillett he was instrumental in founding the &ldquo;Norfolk
News&rdquo; and other newspapers published by that company, and
was largely interested in the &ldquo;Star,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Morning Leader&rdquo; and the &ldquo;East Anglian Daily
Times.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1862 Mr. Colman was appointed Sheriff of
Norwich, and in 1867 was elected Mayor.&nbsp; He was first
nominated for Parliamentary <a name="page493"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 493</span>honours upon the unseating on
petition of Mr. Tillett in 1871.&nbsp; His Conservative opponent
was Sir Charles Legard, whom he defeated by 1,200 votes.&nbsp;
This was the last election contested by open voting, in
Norwich.&nbsp; At the General Election of 1874 Mr. Tillett, freed
of his disabilities, was nominated as colleague of Mr. Colman;
the Conservative candidates were Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Sir
Henry Stracey, Bart.&nbsp; Mr. Colman and Mr. Huddleston were
returned.&nbsp; The next election took place in 1880, when the
Liberal party once more made a strenuous effort to secure the
return of Mr. Tillett by the aid of Mr. Colman&rsquo;s
popularity.&nbsp; The Conservative nominees were Mr. Henry Harben
and the Hon. W. F. B. Mainwaring.&nbsp; The Liberals were
returned by an overwhelming majority.&nbsp; At the election of
1885 occurred the first indication of the disasters which were to
befall Liberalism in Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Harry Bullard was
nominated to oppose Mr. Colman, with whom as second Liberal
candidate was Mr. R. S. Wright.&nbsp; For the first time in his
political career Mr. Colman had to be content with second place,
for Mr. Bullard was returned at the head of the poll with 7,297
votes, against 6,666 polled by Mr. Colman, and 6,251 by Mr.
Wright.&nbsp; Mr. Bullard was unseated on petition, and it was
stated at the time that Mr. Colman was opposed to the course
taken by his party.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel Hoare was then elected
unopposed in the place of Mr. Bullard.&nbsp; At the General
Election in 1886 Mr. Colman regained his former position at the
head of the poll with 6,295 votes as against 6,156 polled by Mr.
Hoare, who had Mr. C. S. Read as his colleague.&nbsp; This
election was noteworthy as the last occasion upon which Mr.
Tillett was nominated.&nbsp; In 1892 Mr. Colman made his last
appearance as a Parliamentary candidate, and with him was
nominated Mr. James Bedford.&nbsp; Mr. Hoare, Conservative
candidate, was returned by a majority of 311 above Mr. Colman;
and the representation of the city remained thus until the
General Election of 1895, when Mr. Colman retired, and for the
first time in sixty years the Conservative party returned two
members, Mr. Hoare and Sir Harry Bullard.&nbsp; Mr. Colman, who
was one of the greatest benefactors in Norwich, was held in
deserved esteem alike by political friends and opponents, and
many expressions of public regret were recorded.&nbsp; He was
predeceased (on the 15th) by his mother, Mrs. Mary Colman, who
died at Town Close Lodge, in her 93rd year.&nbsp; It was
announced at a meeting of the Norwich Town Council on October
18th that Mr. Colman had bequeathed to the Castle Museum, free of
duty, his collection of oil paintings and water colours by
Norfolk and Norwich artists.&nbsp; The collection was valued at
&pound;5,000.</p>

professional career designed many ecclesiastical buildings, and
restored others.&nbsp; He also planned most of the modern grand
stands upon the principal race courses in England.&nbsp; Mr.
Clark was appointed judge by the Jockey Club in 1852, and was the

Docking Hall.&nbsp; A certain Hon. Hugh Charles Hare, who was
rector of Docking from 1708 to 1711, was also rector of

books to Docking, where they had remained for nearly two hundred

position of the city at the present time is such that it is
undesirable to now embark upon any scheme of whatsoever nature
for the erection of a new town-hall, which would involve the

scheme do stand over until the re-valuation of the city has been

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
